What interests you the most about building a freelance career?


The greatest pleasure I get from working as a freelancer is coming into a completely new environment and helping product teams to get focused and organized towards making a true and positive impact in the market.

It is not just about changing the world out there, but also helping to shape a positive and productive environment where great ideas can be channeled and tested in the market.

I also like the fact that I only work with a customer for a set period of time as one often finds that after 1 - 2 years you have added all that you can add to a team / organization and it is time to move on.



When working with a client remotely, what do you consider the key to success?

It's important to set very clear goals, boundaries and clarify expectations up front.
This is why I like to run a short, agile team forming exercise in order to achieve this.

It is also important to have a clear structure for collaborating with set times for planning, standups, reviews etc. so that progress on the product is transparent and open to allow for feedback.








As a curious and open personality my career has straddled many
spheres including: IT / Telecoms Support, Software Development,
Project & Product management, being a Founder, as well as Product, Team & Organizational Coaching.

For over a decade I have been involved in developing products, leading product initiatives and coaching product teams (PO's, SM'd and Developers) helping them to focus on providing value for the customer, clarifying their ideas into product strategies, roadmaps and Product Backlogs, as well as improve their collaboration and making their work more transparent to their stakeholders.
