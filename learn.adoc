==== ToC Thinking Process

https://www.tocinstitute.org/toc-thinking-processes.html
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_processes_(theory_of_constraints)
It's also described in this book by Eli: https://www.amazon.com/Its-Not-Luck-Eliyahu-M-Goldratt-audiobook/dp/B00IFI58YW/
and Bill Dettmer: amazon.com/Logical-Thinking-Process-Systems-Approach-ebook/dp/B004GKMJUY
though I just read Eli's book.
But if you want a light introduction to one of the techniques (perhaps the most valuable one), which is called Evaporating Cloud (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporating_Cloud), you can check out this book (http://amazon.com/CorkScrew-Solutions-Impossible-Constraints-Simplified-ebook/dp/B08LKH5M3V) from Clarke Ching:

While we're at Clarke Ching, here are his two wonderful books on ToC and constraint management
Rolling Rocks Downhill (Agile + ToC) (https://www.amazon.com/Rolling-Rocks-Downhill-Business-mentions-ebook/dp/B00PJ8HBW8)
The Bottleneck Rules (this one is very short) (https://www.amazon.com/Bottleneck-Rules-More-Working-Harder-ebook/dp/B07DCFR7B4/)
