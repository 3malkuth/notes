== 20171203 Cheetahs Rugby Greig Wegerle
I had a dream I was asked to consult to the soccer team in Bloem. As I walked around I bumped into Greg Wegerle who had been asked to consult to the cheetahs rugby team. They had had problems with their supporters, but there seemed to be a general desire by the team leadership for kingdom input. Greg told me it was tough as 3 days a week he was in Bloem and often only made it home by Saturday afternoon after flying home for the weekend, but he was confident God had called him to the task and was jubilant about spreading the kingdom there.
