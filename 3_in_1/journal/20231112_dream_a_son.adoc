=== Dream of a son

U2 ballads
Song you ate my hiding place. You always hear my heart with songs of enduring love.

Waiting on Lord for fresh fire.
My sermon was open beforehand on portal for people to comment.

City with beautiful sunset.

He hasn't given up on me!!

Prophet speaks over me.

Do you want a son. Yes! Many!

What you have on your life is bigger than what the local Church can bear.
There will be a verbal confirmation that it's time to go.
I will bear with u as u have beared with me.

Is there anyway we can do Repentance with joy?
