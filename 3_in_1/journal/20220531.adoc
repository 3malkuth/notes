I had a dream last night that I was on a Church Camp
that looked a little like a mall / hotel.
I remember going to my Mother's room and she had a
make-up table with mirrors and a hand held mirror.

I went out of the room into the mall and there was a pizza store.
Dave Whalley was there and we made pizza together.
Suddenly there was a sense God was talking to me and said
that we were called to live as the new man - like Mars Settlers / Astronauts
that don't belong anymore to the culture of the earth.
