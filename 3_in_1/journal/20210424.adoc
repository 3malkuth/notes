* I had a dream last night
* At NCCB, I asked for help to renovate the roof of my house that was attached to the Church
* was also preparing to preachand people were prophecying over me when...
* Jesus said to me,"Why do you concern yourself with the works of man?"
** He was asking me why I was wasting my time on earthly things or the concerns of our generation that are temporal, misguided and not building for eternity.
** I felt I was also being challenged about sexual purity (mast.)
