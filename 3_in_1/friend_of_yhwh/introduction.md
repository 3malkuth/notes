## Introduction

Whenever I read Exodus 33 & 34 I am always drawn by the way in which it describes how YHWH related to Mosheh (Moses).
It says He spoke to him "as a man speaks to a friend". The deepest desire of my heart has been to have a relationship with YHWH like this.
The New Covenant teaches us that we have something better in that YHWH comes and makes his home within us (1 John).
I think this tells us that all of us can have this deep intimate relationship with YHWH.
In fact, when we are saved we enter into this relationship, the question is do we choose to open ourselves to this fulness or do we live a life where we put barriers between us and YHWH and pull back?

I believe focusing on relationship or friendship with YHWH is one of the keys to breaking out of a "religious" mindset.
As we focus on relating to YHWH and learning to respond to His being we move away from trying to live a ritualistic life: 
wasting time on trying to "please the gods" with our rituals and sacrifices and instead focusing on responding to and walking with YHWH.

In this book I want to explore what it means to be a friend of YHWH and what culture we need to develop in our hearts and daily actions to walk in this wonderful gift - friendship with our King, Savior and creator of the Universe.
