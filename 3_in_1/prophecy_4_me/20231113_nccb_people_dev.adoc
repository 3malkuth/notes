* Last night I had a dream about NCCB and the Bells and Dan Webster.
* I was walking around the campus during the week,
** during working hours and there were so many seminars etc. happening
* I thought to myself,"Shouldn't these people be working?"
* I thought I must be doing the wrong job if people have time to for these activities!
* I had a sense that many of them were people with major problems, perhaps jobless
* They were taking the time to develop themselves though
* I had the strong impression this was only about developing people and nothing else was going to distract (building projects etc.)
