== Anna

== Why I chose you?
* Looking for someone who would choose me and follow me

== Feel of a lack of unity
* V&X exposed division between us
** You quickly got on the trip of how...
*** You feel trapped by structures and smothered
*** I have nothing to say to you
* This makes me feel disrespected and exposes us to being an immature couple
** I believe we can grow here

== Orderliness
** Our bed stinks and our bed washing is dirty
** I need to regularly clean up the fridge and get rid of junk, simplify and order it to make room for new things

== Investing in our relationship
* We don't take enough time for us
* When was the last time we went on a date?
* How often do we align and connect during the week?
* We wanted to pray together
