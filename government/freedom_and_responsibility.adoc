== Freedom and Responsibility
One of the challenges we have in the west is that people want theirbread buttered on both sides.
Many people living off the state dpon't want to be told what to do with their lives;
however, this is wanting freedom without responsibility! Why should a hard working citizen who pays
for their food and shelter not have a say in how that money gets spent and ultimately some say in the decisions
these people make?
