== Citizens need time to "do Government"
* Ancient Greek Democracy's were built on the fact that the citizens had slaves who worked for them so they had time to involve themselves in governmental affairs
* We need to regulate and create time for citizens to be involved in their own democracies at least on a local level.
* With the power of industrialization & AI this should be possible in most developed democracies
** 30 Hour work week? Or one day a month?
** People and companies pay less tax as people more involved in democracy
