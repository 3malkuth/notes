= Taxation
* Taxation should not exceed 10%
** This means that anything else should be done by private entities if a service is required
* Taxation reduction should be used to support desired behaviour
** Anti-Pattern - use taxation to punish
** Example Children: Pay them pocket money for doing the right things, not reduce pocket money for doing things wrong
