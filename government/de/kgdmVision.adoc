= A kingdom vision for Germany

== The Journey so far

== Where are we now?
* Germyn was rebuilt materially after the war
* But there is a spiritual void that was never addressed after the war
* People tried to fill the void with Socialism, Marxism, American Individualism and every other ...ism, but not God
* Now people live in a space where they have no compelling vision of the future
* The prevailing culture of seeking to maintain my safety, and material comfort is not strong enough to challenge the forces working against the country: china, islam etc.
* Without knowing it we are facing cultural collapse because of a lack of vision
** My people perish for lack of vision
