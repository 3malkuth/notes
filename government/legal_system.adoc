== Legal System
* Encourage people to solve as many of their own problems as possible without going to the courts
* We need a counterbalance for the creation of laws where a seperate group of lawyers are incentivized to simplify, reduce and block duplicate laws etc.
** They should also be incentivized to word laws in a manner anyone can understand.
