### 1 Peter 3:1-7

#### Subjection explained
The word for subjection here is the word: [ὑποτάσσω (hoop-ot-as'-so)](https://biblehub.com/greek/5293.htm)
which means "to place or rank under, to subject, mid. to obey".
Before you turn red and explode in outrage I would like to put this in context:
* Luke 2:51 - Jesus placed himself in subjection to his parents
* 1 Corinthians 15:27 - All things are to be placed in subjection to Jesus (under his feet)
* Ephesians 5:24 - The Church is subjected to Christ
* Colossians 3:18 - wives be subject to your husbands
* Titus 2:9 - Slaves be subject to their masters

#### Winning your spouse
Wonderful that men can have their hearts won for the kingdom by the conduct of their wives.

#### Focus of Beauty
It is not bad being beautiful, but the focus of your activity to make yourslef beautiful should be on tending to your heart, not your outward appearance.
Being submitted to their own husbands.
