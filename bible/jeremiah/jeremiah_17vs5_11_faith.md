### Jeremiah 17:5-11
Those who put their trust in flesh & blood etc. will be under a curse:
* They won't perceive good things when they happen
* Their lives will feel like they are living in a desert even if they are wealthy etc.

Those who trust in the Lord will be blessed:
* Like a tree planted next to a stream
* Will always be fruitful and green

Our minds are more deceitful than anything else... incurably bad!
YHWH probes the hearts of people looking deep into their beings
Person who gathers wealth by unjust means never reaps the benefits of their work
Before life is over he will lose ill gotten gains.
At the end of his life it will be clear they were foolish.
