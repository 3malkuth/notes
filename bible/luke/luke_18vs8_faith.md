### Luke 18:8
```
...Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?‚Äù (WEB)
```

After discussing his second coming, and providing a parable on how we should always pray and
not give up, Jesus ends by re-assuring us his justice will come quickly, and he an important question,
"When I return, will I find faith on the earth?".

In the western world we have tried to remove the concept of "God" and the divine from society.
Society is only interested in keeping the values and cultural niceties of religion,
but no one wants to deal with the messiness of a real God who speaks, and acts and intervenes in daily life
and history. This is a preposterous idea for the "sophisticated, modern man": a God who is actually there.

Even in the Church we meet on a Sunday often more for the opportunity to meet our friends etc.
But do we come with expectation that the God we serve will move and act based on our petitions.
I must admit for a long time my heart has grown cold. The spirit of this age and that which hangs over
Europe has often created something of a fog oer my eyes and heart, where through disappointment and disnterest
I have not expected much from YHWH.
