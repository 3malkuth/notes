## Stand up & Join the Great Assembly
* Write down anything distracting you
* Choose connect H&E
* Call to join the Great Assembly
* Jesus as Head & the Church here and in heaven
* Out of this place I want u to receive the Word
* We will join with heaven to worship

## Season of Growing / Expanding our Hearts
* On Thursday at Meeting two weeks ago...
* Model of 7 areas of life (with authority structures)
* We are in a time of decision and time of growing & expanding our hearts
* What is the Heart?
  * Mind / Place of Thought (Matthew 9:4)
  * Will / Decision Making (Acts 11:23)
  * Emotions (John 16:22)
  * Conscience (Hebrews 10:22)
  * Mess it all up (Mark 12:29-30)
* World impact requires mature hearts
* Need to be able to carry the revelation, favour and anointing from the Father
* We need to build out new areas of our inner being to be able to carry what the Father wants to give us
  * This also means reconsidering our theology of the end times - need to get our of your "echo chamber"
* The World teaches you need to grab a hold of your destiny
  * The kingdom does not work that way!!! We allow YHWH to expand our hearts, build character
  * When we are ready our Father in Heaven gives us the territory.
  * There may be a fight, but we are always fighting from the position of having received. We don't need to grab

## Growing your Heart in Business
* Want to talk about expanding our hearts in the area of business
* Cultural change is established by changing what people do
* Hippies didn't change culture - the engineers who took their ideas and est. them in their products and business practices did (e.g. Fairchild Semiconductor)
* Even now companies and their services are being used to est. cultural change e.g. gay pride, think of influence ms and apple had on the world and now google etc.
* I believe this is an are we have neglected as christians for far too long
  * But it will require a change of heart and the way we see the world around us

## Were never called to be alone 
* Jesus said He will make his home in your heart... innermost being.
* Not a long distance relationship.
* Wants to become one with u.
* He has made it possible that we never for one moment in our lives feel:
  * alone
  * lacking in anything... his fulness is available to us

## Anti-Pattern: Products as Functional Saviours
* No need to fill that need for intimacy and wholenes and closeness...
  *  with products which can become idols... or functional saviours (things that try to fill our need for Christ in any area of our lives)
* When you make a purchase ask yourself what problem am I paying this product to solve in my life...
  * ...AND is this something that Jesus should be solving in my life?

## Kingdom purpose of Products
* Of course we are called to produce and consume products
* Most of the products the World has produced are the fruits of hearts influenced by:
  * Fear (Insurance, Socialism, Communism, the Prussian Army)
  * the desire to dominate (war) - Computer Systems, Modern Weapons, Systems etc.
  * the desire to fill the lusts of the flesh - Fast Food, many Fashion products, Sex Toys, Pornography, much Media...
* Jesus calls us to two important things that are the fruit of the new life he has given us:
  * Out of the place of love we are called to SERVE others and STEWARD his creation
  * Also called to DISCIPLE the Nations - our products and services can help people walk in His ways
  * What would products look like if focused on furthering kingdom principles?
    * Financial products that re-establish the extended and nuclear family as God's social system
* Believe we need a new generation of kingdom product developers
* Famous christian business people and scientists were quakers (Cadbury), Samuel Morse, Blaise Pascal, Isaac Newton, Faraday...
* Need more nerds in the church again.
  *I love surfing, but I don't like the surf culture which tends to be about disengaging from the problems of the world...
  * This is hard work, but if your heart is not structured for it you won't engage in this space
    * And another generation goes by locked in the dead systems of this world

## Need for Kingdom Visionaries
* Build Products that are birthed, grow and decompose within our natural ecosystem
* Imagine if you connected your phone to a tree when u got home
* Imagine if our products lived in the garden
* Imagine if after 2 years we could place our phones in the garden and they would decompose
* Working environments that encouraged families to work together
  * No mothers at home isolated and fathers constantly on the road away from their families
* Restaurants that are family / children friendly...

## New Generation
* Prepared to put in the hard work
* Don't follow the "dial out" christian culture of our day
* Put in the hours to be capable of addressing the issues of our day

## The Gospel - Restore All things
* Jesus said He would restore all things
* Our work in the garden of tending to God's creation is still a resp.
* Christians should be at the forefront of the green revolution
* Example of my Mother who always cleaned up wherever she saw dirt
* Avenue for us to lead and keep things in  kingdom order... also have a restraining influence on the world
* Avenue for evangelism
* When Jesus returns will he find us at work spreading the culture of the kingdom or idle, lacking faith, just waiting for this "bad" world to face judgement?

## Conclusion: Chnage of Heart is needed
* We are called to be a part of the Great Assembly and to display God's wisdom to the World
* Our Church culture has often shyed away from the problems of this world
* We need a change of heart that once again positions us to deal with and concern ourselves with serving humanity
  * Caring for the needs of people and creation
  * Bringing kingdom life into this world through the products and services we create
  * By doing so restoring and not disrupting
* Those change by the Gospel should be leading the way
* We need to allow the Spirit to grow our hearts so that we can be courageous and people of faith
* Start with following Jesus and begin to serve
* If you want to respond to Jesus come to the front
* Let's go into a time of workship
