### Bible Study

### Kephale in Conjunction with Jesus
All these texts show clearly that the context is Christ being not just the source, but the authority over everything.
Why would the Apostles suddenly change the meaning for the relationship between men and women?

>15 Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:  
>16 For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:  
>17 And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.  
>18 And he is the **head** (κεφαλὴ, kephalē) of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.  
>19 For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell;  
>20 And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.  
>
>Colossians 1:15-20 KJV
