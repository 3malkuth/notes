## Genesis

Some people say that Eve existed in Adam before she was taken out of Adam.
This does not make sense as otherwise Adam would not have felt lonely.
We see that Eve's bodily substance was taken out of Adam, but not her Spirit and Soul.
This was formed and placed into the substance of her physicla body taken from Adam's side.
The two shall become "one FLESH", the item man and woman share is the physical body, but not the spirit and soul.
