## Government

### Genesis 1 - Order's Focus: Goodness, Life, Flourishing
The Bible begins with a lecture in governance. We understand from the beginning that YHWH speaks and moves upon the deep (the primal substance of the universe) to bring things into order so that life is not just sustained, but life is able flourish! YHWH's idea of governance is focused on creating the necessary conditions for life to flourish! This may be seen as making things good!


### Genesis 2: Godly Government is based on Family
The government of Heaven is the government of family.
