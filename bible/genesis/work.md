## Genesis

### Chapter 1

#### Creativity
YHWH is creative, it is in His nature to create and produce. Since we are made in His image we too have a deep desire and need to create. Most of life is spent in harnessing and refining our YHWH-Given Talents, putting them to good use to serve others and to steward His creation.

#### Order from Chaos (vs. 2)
It is also in His nature to put that which is dark and disorderly into order, bringing light on it. A lot of work concerns itself with taking something that is in chaos and transforming it into something useful or ordering it in such a way that it is, fit for purpose. YHWH ordered the created World making it useful for His purposes wherein His created beings could live and flourish.

#### Speaking into being... (vs. 3+)
YHWH's creative work begins with Him speaking things that are not into being. When we begin an endeavour ("a work") we too should speak it into being, speaking life over the work. Too many people destroy the work they are doing in that even before they have begun they speak it down and destroy it with their tongues.

#### The fruit is abundance (vs. 20+)
YHWH's creative work produces life, abundance, an overflow of goodness. The work we do should also produce this life. If you are not seeing this taking place you should ask yourself where the problem lies:
* is the death my hands are producing the product of the brokeness and death within me?
  * (This is usually the case no matter your circumstances)
* am I prevented from producing life based on the environment I have placed myself in?
* is the enemy trying to block and prevent me from producing life?

All of the above scenarios will require you to go through a process of reflection and prayer until the breakthrough comes.

#### Principle of producing after its kind (vs. 24+)
Each created being has a specific purpose and you are called to produce fruit according to the nature YHWH has given you. For people it is so important to avoid the trap of comparison and jealousy as this will take your eye off of producing that for which you were created.

Your greatest joy in life will come when you are doing the work for which you were created or the work that has the blessing of the Spirit (Ruach) upon it. You will feel His pleasure and joy as you work.

#### Bless your Work!
Speak a blessing over your work and that which YHWH has entrusted to you!
