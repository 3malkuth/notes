== Elia: Mens Grill Evening 2024-02-16

=== I came to Germany expecting...
* a prosperous & bountiful Nation
* a Nation filled with happy families
* a nation pushing the boundaries of science and technology
* a nation filled with beautiful nature, architecture, fashion...
* a nation with a beautiful culture and history
* a Nation of enquiry, of learning and open debate

=== But what did I find...
* a Godless Nation
* a Nation filled with brothels and a centre of prostitution
* a Nation that no longer knows truth & justice
* a perverted Nation of people lost in the delusion of multiple genders and sexual orientations
* a nation that silences truth by calling any idea that doesn't fit the accepted narrative
* a nation with the veneer of prosperity, but spiritually, and morally destitute, corrupt, broken
** as an orphan that managed to find gold and dressed as a prince, but inward still an orphan.

=== But what has disturbed me the most...
* are the number of men in churches around the Nation
** cowards, lacking courage
** or too pre-occupied with gatherinig more and more material wealth
** and not committing yourselves to extending the kingdom

=== What will it take for us to wake up?
* How bad do things need to get before we...
** get up off the sofa
** switch off the TV, the ipad, the mobile phone, the playstation...?
* Will we be known as a generation that failed to establish God's purposes?
* I don't want to be ashamed when I meet my Saviour face to face

=== I came to Germany
* To seek a mighty army of Holy Warriors
* An army that would go out in the strength of the Lord to change the direction of this Nation!
* God wants you to enlist in His army!

=== But I don't feel strong enough
* Gideon
* For such a time as this
* My life is a mess! Then clean it up
* Our enemy is afraid of the following people...
** They overcame with the Blood of the Lamb and the words of their testimony
** They didn't love their lives unto death

=== Aber Alex...
* I am so tired
** I only accept this from people with small kids
** Stop staying up till 2:00 in the moring watching Netflix or playing on the SE
** we need to get our priorities straight people
* I don't have time
** what has got you so pre-occupied?
** Why do you love your life more than you love Jesus?
** I need to pay off my 2nd and 3rd houses in Spain and my BMW
* I am waiting for the Lord to call me
** Jonathan and his armorbearer...

=== OK so Alex what do you want me to do?
* Find a band of brothers and some territory to take for the kingdom
* Modern terms: Freunde was sind bereid für dich to sterben und ein königreichs Projekt

=== Repent
* Usually when a preacher calls people to repent
** there is weeping and confession
** And as much as it is important to ask the Lord for forgiveness
** It is more important to make a decision and plan what you are going to do to change your current direction
* So everyone get out your phones
* Open your Note App
* We are going to spend the next 5' writing down concrete actions of what we are going to change
* Write down concrete actions you are going to take to be a part of extending the kingdom
* Examples:
** Take the bus daily to work so that you can share the gospel
** Go into politics
** Go into the business realm with your kingdom
** ...
* If you are not speaking the name of Jesus in the project you are not extednign the Kingdom - we need to get radical as the times call for radicality

* To end off use this evening to find men with the same heart as you and make an appointment to meet again within the next 2 weeks
* Not to talk about who's susccessfult, but to share your heart, reall chllaenges, victories and failures...
