== Hebrew versus Greek Thought

=== Why are we talking about this?

* Hebrew thinking lives in the area of the real
** what can be touched, felt sensesed, seen etc.
* Greek thinking lives in the abstract
* I feel that our greek thinking has lead us to the West to be:
** Arrogant and proud (we don't htink like natives...)
** Unable to deal with our emotions and inner world
*** e.g. high levels of depression
* Greek thinking has sought to disconnect us from the world God made around us
* Led to intellectual arrogance and the stifling of the Spirit in many Churches
*** e.g. high levels of depression
* Greek thinking has sought to disconnect us from the world God made around us
* Led to intellectual arrogance and the stifling of the Spirit in many Churches
* Programmed people to be unable to believe and live by faith
* Greek thinking also leads to weird spirituality - Gnosticism which is also rife in the West

=== What is the current state of affairs in the West?

=== What is the goal?
* That our minds think like Jesus...
* That we are able to truly sense what the Spirit is doing and to follow
** Create a culture that helps people to come out of greek thinking and to embrace kingdom thinking

=== Analysis

*Mars Hill*

* Paul had one of his most ineffective sermons on Mars Hill
* After that he went to Corinth and we see how he preached very differently there
** I did not come with wise words etc.
** Mars Hill showed him that these so called wise words led to him only stoking the intellectual arrogance of the Athenians

*Try explain something simple using Greek thinking*

* Example of tribe that needed to wait for their souls to catch up...
* Try and explain that using greek abstract thought
