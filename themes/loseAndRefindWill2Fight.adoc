= Losing the will to fight and refinding it
* In 1984 the amin actor is tortured and brainwashed so much he loses the will and ability to fight for what he believes in
* I feel many christians find themselves in this situation
* You need to learn how to approach pain and suffering in your life so that it doesn't break you, instead you allow God to shape you through it
* Many Christians have gone through years of many disappointments which is like a brainwashing, torture ffect that eventually removes the desire to fight.
* How do we find our way again?
