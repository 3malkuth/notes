= James

== Why?
* "The Trespass of Partiality"
** Feel too many christians only invest their time with people they find wealthy or cool
*** James 2 rebuke


== Current State
* Few deep relationships
* Many doing their own thing
* Many feel disconnected

== Goal


== Analysis
* We are called to unity, but so many not interested in investing their lives in Church
* Let's be honest we ahave all been burned in one way or another, and aren't keen
* I find myself often pulling back also because I see we are stuck in a circle
Often feel we are wasting our time in Church
** Do our meetings do more harm than good? Also includes meetings do nothing?
* Relationships are like the World - superficial
* We all put on our Sunday face...
* I can't believe after so many years that we are still doing this?
* Why can't we love one another and build our lives together?

== Countermeasures
* Get involved in your Nation, in Politics
* Seek to become a leader in your Organization & Industry
* Prepare your children to become "Captains of Industry"


== Plan


== Learnings
