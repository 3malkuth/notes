= Is it possible to combine Scientifc Thinking and being Spirit Led?


== Scientific Thinking
* Scientific Thinking
** Hypothesis
** Run an Experiment
** Measure the effects
** Draw insights from the result and start with new hypothesis...

* PDCA
** PLan
** Do
** Check
** Act / Adjust
** Plan again based on insights...

== Spiritual Living - I learn to:
** Ride the wave
** By being aware and growing in awareness
** Learning to be still and listen (Kgdm Meditation) - Calming the Mind
*** Being aware of His Presence by being Present
* I allow the spirit to lead the mind and body
* This requires training?

== Bringing them together
* I receive a revelation which I believe to be true
* However, it needs to be tested
** I act on that revelation in faith
** I see / perceive (measure) the results of that action
** I gain insghts from those results
** I go back to the Lord with questions and perhaps I receive revelation or better understanding and act.
