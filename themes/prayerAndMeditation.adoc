= Kingdom Prayer & Meditation

== Thoughts
* I notice I find it difficult to pray for people / things where I don't have a direct connection / relationship with that person / thing etc.
* I also find it difficult to force pray for a theme
** I find I often need to get to a place where I sense what is on God's heart and then I begin to pray into that theme with conviction, authority and a general feeling that Heaven is behind this theme.
