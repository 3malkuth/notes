== 1980 - 1987

=== In the Womb
My Mother became pregnant with me right in the middle of her starting her own private practice.
I think that because she was under so much stress she didn't realize she was pregnant for several months (so I am told).
Unfortunately, I believe this had an adverse effect on my health as I was born premature and struggled to breathe from the start of my life.
A health problem I would struggle with for many years.

=== Birth
I was born in Garden City Clinic, Johannesburg, South Africa on the 13th of December 1980.
I ws born premature to my mother who was completely stressed out from starting her own practice.
She was so finished that the first person who held me when I was born was my Father as my Mother did not have the strength to hold me.
