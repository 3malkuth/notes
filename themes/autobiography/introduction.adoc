== Introduction
Many people write their autobiography in order to tell the world about an amazing life they had.
I must admit this book will probably be a disappointment for those reading it in search of adventure etc.
I am actually writing this book more for me than for anyone else.
I am at a stage of my life where I see certain unhealthy patterns playing themselves out.
If I don't deal with them now, I am concerned they will define the rest of my life.
I feel I can only deal with them by working through my past before the Lord.
Who knows maybe there may be some insights in here for you.
If this book helps you I will be delighted that atleast someone else will have benefited from my life experiences.
