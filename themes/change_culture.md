# Change Culture

* Change Culture by Changing what people do...
* Who started the real cultural revolution in the 60's?
  * It wasn't the hippies at the 1967, "Summer of love" event in San Francisco...
  * It was the scientists and engineers working just down the road at Fairchild Semiconductor and the startups that were spawned in the valley.

* With Hollywood's media and San Francisco's Products America transformed the Globe's Culture
  * But how did they do it?
  * They created products!!! They got you to pay them to change your own culture through the purchase of their cool products that everyone wanted...

* Today we see the same thing with Elon Musk. He has a vision of the future and he is using the products he is selling the world to move the world in that direction.

* I was reading the book about Israel "Startup Nation" and it was so interesting when one of the leaders in Israel said to young activist: stop wasting your time and rather start a business if you want to change things...

* Something we are going to need to change is our understanding of how we are going to shape culture. Though there is no single method, I think the Church has been too disengaged from the world and not involved on the cutting edge of science and technology in order for us to shape the future.

* We have created a culture where it is OK to just cop out and become a spiritual hippy or doomsday prophet whereas I believe the Lord is calling us back into the market place to create products and services that will shape the way people will do life and accordingly form their ways of doing life in a kingdom way. We would also be able to better steward the planet and helpo shape a more gracious, kingdom world culture.

## How would one go about finding ideas...
* Identify a kingdom principle you would like to see in the world established
* Ask if this value was a product how would I use it to solve my problem in this area of life...
* We pay products to solve problems in our lives.

## What could some kingdom products look like?
* Astronomical & Agricultural Calendar
* Online leadership & parenting assessment with a follow up coaching session
* Courting App that helps singles to meet someone in a safe environment with other people they know...
