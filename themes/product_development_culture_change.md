# Change culture through product development!

* If we are going to truly be players in culture change we are going to need to look at the lessones of historey and our time concerning those who have changed culture in the past and present

## Examples
* The Quakers
  * Hot Chocolate to replace coffee and alcohol?
* Fairchild Semiconductors - real changers of culture (different org. struct.) whilst hippeis were singing songs and not changing anything
* Israel need entrepreneurs and not activists 
* Steve Jobs & Bill Gates - Personal Computing
* Sir... Creator of the Internet
