== Why?
* last time I gave a quick introduction to the new Jerusalem
** That we are a part of it now if we are in Christ
** This city has a purpose at the moment
** It is the mandate Jesus has given to His Church
** The Trinity & the Church will be the inhabitants of this City
* Today I want to focus on the aspect of this city being at war
* We have a mandate to the change the culture of this earth and make it look more like heaven
** Matthe 28: Disciples of all Nations
** Matthew 6: On earth as it is in Heaven

== Current State
* Seems Jesus needs to do this himself
* At the moment the kingdom seems to be advanced by Him and despite the activities of the Church
* So many of us have bunkered up and we are waiting for Jesus to return and try to have as little possible to do with the World as we can
* So many of us are living in fear or are on some weird spiritual crazy journey where we are of no practical use to the World around us

== Goal
* The culture of Heaven becomes the de facto culture on earth

== Analysis
=== Don't Bunker Up
* We need to reject this mindset of bunkering up and waiting for the rapture
** Jesus had two parables where he was hard on those not ready for his return
** Virgins and their oil
** The servant who did no invest
** Jesus wants to find us actively at work extending His Kingdom when He returns
** Let us not be ashamed at His coming in that he finds us paralyzed by fear and in hiding when He returns

== Small Teams have always changed the World
* I enjoy gathering for times of corporate worship
* However, the Word and History show me how powerful it is when people come together as a small team with a vision and begin to pray and act on their prayers
** The world is changed
** Jesus and His Disciples
** Paul and His Team
** Clapham Sect
** ...
* I believe we need to move into a season where Churches send out small teams to do what Daniel and his friends did, bring the World out of captivity to Babylon and to make the rules of Babylon acknowledge Jesus as King

=== Head & Not the Tail
* Let's be those who are the head and not the tail
* Learn form the Israeli's
** Startup Nation
* We should be the cutting edge Innovators
** This will only happen when we choose to value this World
* We should follow the pattern of Daniel
** Look at my notes on Daniel and Joseph

=== Courage
* Courage to serve those we think are our enemies
** Other political parties
** A boss who is a bit of a Dictator
** Difficult Teachers / Professors who don't share the same views as us
* Grow in Courage
** Running lots of little expermients

=== Mistakes & Restitution
* Part of Courage - Allow each other the space to make mistakes
* First thing I want to know in a group is when I make a mistake how does forgiveness and restitution work in this group?
** GFK formula as start of conversation...

== Countermeasures
* Get involved in your Nation, in Politics
* Seek to become a leader in your Organization & Industry
* Prepare your children to become "Captains of Industry"
