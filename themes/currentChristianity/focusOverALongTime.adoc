== Focus over a long time

We need a generation that is prepared to commit to fighting a battle for the long term, in team, not as solo cowboys seeking their own glory.
We also need churches to release their people for these long term battles.
That means less focusing on gathering for events almost every day of the week.
We need to create supporting structures in our churches to support these teams.
