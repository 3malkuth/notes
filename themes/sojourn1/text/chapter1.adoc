== Ibram is Found

[quote]
____
Ibram was a boy like many in that age:
no Father, no family, and no future.

Ibram was awoken by the warm dry desert breeze blowing in from the salt sea. He got up to get a drink of water as his eyes surveyed the horizon where a corvette was gliding into the star port after a long journey through the system.

The sun was just beginning to climb and with it the temperatures of this desert port city.

Ibram took a drink from the fountain at the intersection and walked to the corner of the main market where his dead mother had forced him to beg since he was a child, and where he continued to meet out a living now that she had left this world. He was the son of a whore; treated as a dog. With no future and no past, simply destined to scratch out a living before embracing his eternity in the bowels of hell itself. Children like him, he was told, never make it to paradise. They are destined for damnation.

The streets had numbed and hardened him. He didn’t care for much: for life, for love, for manners, for beauty. He did not care. Life had trained him into living for the now, making sure his belly was full was his primary concern, everything else was just a waste of time. He had heard merchants talk about their travels beyond the system to the very edges of the galaxy where they had seen numerous colourful, diverse and yet dangerous cultures. But such things were just the idle talk of those who wished an audience to sell their goods.

The day past by slowly. There was not much going on in the port. The corvette that arrived in the morning was the only ship to enter the port this day and from the looks of things they were not carrying anything of great importance, they were simply passing through.

As the day passed into the late afternoon he had only received a few coins. He realized he would have to go and steal some food if he was going to eat today. He gathered his things and headed for the blue quarter where the windows to the kitchens were low to the ground and were often left open to get the best of the what fresh air one could get on this planet.

After working his way through the streets he found a suitably quiet alley. He checked a few of the windows and found one that opened on a kitchen where the house seemed empty and dimly lit inside: perfect for his plans. He slipped in cautiously through the window looking for any signs of a pet and worked his way to the door of the kitchen to check if anyone was in the house.
He stuck his head around the corner... suddenly, he was pulled inside another room, his mouth gaged, arms and legs tied up. He wanted to scream, but it was too late.

He sat in the dark for what seemed a half hour and as the schock worked itself off, his captors released his gag. “Son, what are you doing here?” A voice spoke from the darkness. “Sir, I have come to deliver a package,” Ibram exclaimed as he covered himself anticipating a beating, ”Please don’t hurt me! Honestly, I have only come to deliver a package,and then I will be on my way.”

Another voice spoke,"That's a strange way to deliver a package through the kitchen window! Come on, out with the truth!"


A dim light grew in strength in the corner, but a light the boy had never seen before, it seemed to change the atmosphere and immediately bring peace.

A strong yet gentle voice came from the corner,”Anduin, give the boy some room, he is not here to harm us.” The stern voice mumbled something in another language and stepped back from Ibram.

“Thank you, for delivering this package!” The man in the corner exclaimed,”We were waiting for it. Alright, lads lets go we are ready to leave.
Andaren, don’t leave things like this lying around again, this could have placed us all in severe danger.
Boy, thank you, here is a tip for your hard work. We apologize for 
the rude welcome! On your way.”

As they prepared to open the door,  of light penetrated the building and the surrounding street. A voice shouted over a loudspeaker,”OK we have you surrounded!, lay down your weapons, place your hands above your heads and come out slowly one by one and you won’t be harmed!”

Anduin whispered to the man with a gentle yet stern voice, 
”Artür fight or flight?”
He responded,
”Lets go!”

Andarden asked,”What about the boy?” Artür whispered,”We will take him with us… otherwise they will kill him if they capture him.
Ibram was picked up by one of the group, and thrown into the trunk of a robot.

BOOM! The earth shook and a cloud of dust filled the alleyway as the group suddenly disappeared into the dust cloud. Ibram didn’t really register what happened, but all he knew is they were moving off at tremendous pace.

The city police were left scrambling for cover; totally, caught off guard by the explosion.

Artür and his team made good their escape on their helo-horses and quickly made it to their star-corvette managing to escape to hyperspace with a trail of city-guard ships hot on their tails. But once in hyperspace their signal was quickly lost, there was no real way the guard ships could follow, they simply didn’t possess that kind of technology.
