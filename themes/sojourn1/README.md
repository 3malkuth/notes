## chapter 2

As the team settled down Artür opened the trunk of their robotic helper letting Ibram out onto the deck of the hold of the ship. He was still in shock and shaking a little as he stepped out on the floor.

Artür was the first to speak,”Welcome on board the HMS Audacity, A corvette class star-ship, but disguised as an Inter-Galactic Merchant Vessel. We have been on a reconnaissance trip of this star system hunting for enemy activity…”

“enemy activity?” Ibram asked with a question mark on his face.

“Yes, Diablian activity.”
“What or who is that?” Ibram asked looking a little bewildered.
“Diablians are the one and true enemy we face in this galaxy. Many systems and nations ware with each other or are enslaved because of their actions. They are like ghosts with sinister motives seeking to enslave all, they are our eternal enemy and yours, but only if you open your eyes.”

“The true question you face is do you want to stay with us or do you wish to return to your life on Sah’ra? We can often you a truly wonderful future, but it comes at the price of your independence. You must decide. We will be docking at another star city a few days from now. If you wish to leave us we will pay for your fair to return home to your planet.”

“What about our mission, the boy could compromise us!” Andaren exclaimed.
“No need to worry we will be long gone before he is able to tell anyone about where we are.” Artür answered.

After the escape from ???, the Captain invited Ibram to lunch.
“Ibram!”
Yes Sir, he said hesitantly, still afraid to look into his deep eyes.
“Ibram, I have spoken with the King. He is delighted to hear you decided to join us and he is looking forward to meeting you in person. He has asked me to begin your training here before we get back to ??? so that no time is wasted. My boy there is much you need to unlearn and learn in order for you to truly enter into the culture and bond of our culture.”
“Yes, Sir! I am looking forward…”
“Ha hmm,” the captain cleared his throat,”I have not finished yet. Much will be required of you over the next couple of months. It will not be easy, but we will be there to encourage you all the way. The King has assigned me you as a Bond-Son for your training. I will be to you as a Coach, and Mentor...a Father to you. I have full authority over your life. Until you yourself enter into YoungManShip??? I will have complete authority over your life and the decisions you make. You will be to me as a son, and I your Father. This seems much now, but it will work its way out over time.”
“Ya yes Sir,” Ibram stammered somewhat perplexed by the the statement. Ibram had never had a Father, someone to trust in and also to take instruction from.

He loved being alone on the bridge of the caravel as they glided through space. He enjoyed the silence and being able to watch the galaxies, stars and planets pass by, almost like a beautiful piece of moving art. Somehow it gave him peace in his heart, but at the same time it built up in him a sense of destiny, purpose, hope for the future.
