# Hear & Listen

## Introduction
One of my biggest challenges and admittedly fears is that I am always
very unsure whether I am hearing God or whether something is simply
fruits of my own thinking.

When it comes to the question of making decisions in daily life based
on God's principles it is quite easy to verify your thoughts against
God's Word.

But what happens when we begin to have to make decisions based on the
need for special guidance or where you feel you should be stepping out
in faith to pray for the sick, cast out demons etc.

In these cases we really need to be sure we are hearing YHWH. To be honest
if these are the only times we stop to hear from the Lord, we will probably
be very unsure whether or not He is talking to us.

The reality is that we don't spend enough time waiting on the Lord and acting
on what He says as a discipline. Like a muscle: hearing, listening and obeying
is a muscle that also needs training.

In this article I want to talk about what the Word says about this topic and
discuss some practical ways in which we can "grow this muscle".

## What the Bible says

```
13 He who gives answer before he hears, that is folly and shame to him.
Proverbs 18:13 WEB

28 But he said, “On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of God, and keep it.” (or obey it)

17 So faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
Romans 10:17 WEB

19 So, then, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger;
