= Writing

== Theology Books
* I like the idea of writing these books similar to the way the Talmud is written and The Republic
** What I mean is that I like to present discussions around theology as a conversation
** So I like to present the view points as though I was havinga conversation with the authors I am referencing and providing my own thoughts on their thoughts / comments
