== Matthew 5

=== 5:18 - Until Accomplished, Law will not Pass Away
Not one jot... until everything is accomplished. What does this mean?

Everything pertaining to the rituals etc. of the law he fulfille din his death and resurrection and if you are in Christ you no longer have to try to fulfill those requirements.

However, there are still some outstanding prophecies that pertain to the Church in this Age and the second coming of Christ and these things still need to be fulfilled and we His Church have a role in bringing this about - the earth will be filled with the glory of God etc.
