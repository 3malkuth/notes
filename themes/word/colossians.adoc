== Colossians 1

=== 1:19 - 20
* It pleased Father God to place the fullness of the Trinity in Jesus.
* Also to reconcile the fallen World to Himself (The Father, but also I would assume the entire Trinity).
* "All things" would be the Church.
* In heaven and on earth could refer to...
** everything, everywhere or,
** the redeemed in Heaven and those still living on Earth
*** Geneva Bible 1599 Notes...

And thus is justification described of the Apostle, which is one and the chiefest part of the benefit of Christ.
