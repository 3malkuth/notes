# L & H

## Motivation
* Whats the challenge you are facing with unmotivated people?
* You can only briefly extrinsically motivate people
* However, you can create an environment that is motivating...
  * So what are we doing that is blocking people from being motivated?

## Growing & Releasing Leaders
* Setup meeting with Eddie...
* How do u expect to grow leaders if you don't have something like homecells where new leaders can be trained?
  * Are we trying to make excuses and expecting perfection before releasing?
* Focus on helping with the Buildings
  * Sure character is impotant, but the legacy we leave will be in the lives we lead and not the buildings we build
* Don't forget that most of the people the Lord released were not ready from man's perspective...


## Acknowledging your own imperfection and mistakes?
* Are you able to say sorry?
* What thoughts / theologies are you not sure about?
* Who are you accountable to and if they spoke into your life you would take the time immediately to reflect and check if you need to change something in your life?

## Role of the Bible in Faith and key theologies
* How do you see the Bible and how should it be used in a christian's life and church life?
* What do you think about the end times?
* What do you think about hell and judgement etc.
