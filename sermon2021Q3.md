# Sermon 2022 Q3 - Seeking Revival?

* I am praying that YHWH will not judge us here in Europe as enemies, but that He will discipline us as sons.
* I pray for the discipline of the Lord, because his fatherly correction will strengthen us in the long run.
* You need to make at peace with the fact that YHWH is merciful and wrathful at the same time otherwise you
  * will struggle to understand the processes of the Lord that the world is about to experience.
  * Exodus 33 - first a merciful one, but also one who judges...
* For those in Christ we don't experience judgement, but discipline, but I believe like Moses we need to stand in the gap for Europe that YHWH will be merciful and discipline and not destroy with judgement.
* I had a dream... it's time for the eagle to fly again...
