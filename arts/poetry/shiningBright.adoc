= Shining Bright

My young heart sought light in your family,
but I found hardness, jealousy and spite.
I tried many years to fit the mold,
to earn love and respect,
thinking I would find my purpose and meaning.
Instead I found only rejection and small mindedness.

As I turn to the dark, here I find light for my direction, for some reason I find more of you here
than in your family!?

Why?

My desire for your heart for your family dwindles and fades and with it my desire for the picture I have of you.

Is there another you on the other side of this precipice you want to show me or have I fallen into darkness thinking I am in the light?
