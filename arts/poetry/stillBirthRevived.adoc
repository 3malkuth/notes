= Still Birth

Your friends and far flung celebrities gathered and rejoiced at your birth.
Planes passed over, sports events were won at your birth. Your streets were alive with singing and dancing as cours mixed, dance and drank together.


Something about the diaspora coming back to bring new life like a last breath.
