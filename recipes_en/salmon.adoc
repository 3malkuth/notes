=== Salmon

==== Ingredients
* 1 piece of salmon (~ 6cm x 15cm)
* Olive oil or melted butter
* Salt
* Pepper
* Optional: lemon slices, garlic, herbs (like dill or parsley), or your favorite seasoning

==== Instructions
* Preheat the Oven:
** Preheat your oven to 200°C (400°F).
* Prepare the Baking Dish:
** Line a baking dish with parchment paper or lightly grease it with olive oil or butter to prevent sticking.
* Season the Salmon:
** Place the salmon skin-side down in the baking dish.
** Drizzle olive oil or melted butter over the salmon.
** Season with salt and pepper. You can also add any additional seasonings or herbs you like.
** If using, place lemon slices or garlic on top of the salmon for added flavor.
* Bake the Salmon:
** Place the baking dish in the preheated oven.
** Bake for about 12-15 minutes, depending on the thickness of the salmon. A general rule is to bake for about 4-6 minutes per half-inch of thickness.
** The salmon is done when it flakes easily with a fork and is opaque in the center.
* Serve: Remove the salmon from the oven and let it rest for a couple of minutes before serving. You can serve it with sides like vegetables, rice, or a salad.
