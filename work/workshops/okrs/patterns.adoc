=== OKRs



==== History
The history of goal setting!
Goal setting has been a part of human life as long as recorded history.
However, the first attempt to formalise and understand it can be related to Aristotle himself (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_setting[Goal Setting]).

Why do we need goals?
The question has always been do we want to allow life to happen to us or for us to shape the outcome of our lives in some manner?
About being proactive or reactive.

What are OKRs?
OKRs, which stands for Objectives and Key Results, is a goal-setting methodology that has been adopted by organizations such as Google, LinkedIn, and X (Twitter).
The concept of OKRs revolves around setting objectives and defining key results to measure progress towards those objectives.

An objective represents what you want to achieve, while key results are measurable outcomes that indicate progress or success.
For example, if your objective is to increase user engagement, key results could include metrics such as the number of active users or the average time spent on your platform.

The power of OKRs lies in their simplicity and clarity.
They provide a framework for setting ambitious yet achievable goals and aligning teams towards a common purpose.
By implementing OKRs, organizations can foster focus, unity, and velocity in their pursuit of success.

** Avoid articulating objectives and key results in the solution space; stay in the problem space! For example...
*** Problem Space
**** Key result: Users will be able to save 5 minutes uploading data
