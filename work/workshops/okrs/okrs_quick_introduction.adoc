==== OKRS Quick Introduction

===== Introduction

* *Why do we need Goals?*
** Proactive or Reactive?
** We desire to birth dreams into reality
** To align a group of people in their work / combined activities

* *Goals Management System*

* *“Ideas are easy. Execution is everything.”*
** John Doerr

* *What are OKRs?*
** Simple Measureable Goal Statement
** Stands for Objective Key Results
** Ambitious
** Measureable
*** Though not new, many people forget this aspect when settings goals

* *Example*
** I will...
** AS measured by...
** Climb a Mountain
** Got to Mars
** Lose weight

===== History

* *How do you defeat Napoleon?*
** Mission Command - “Auftragstaktik”
** 1800’s - von Moltke (after Jena)
** How do you defeat Napoleon?
** Faster decision making at every level…
** Prussian soldiers - students of critical thinking
** Curriculum expanded beyond military matters into the liberal arts
*** Every class provided opportunities for discussion and debate.
** Created a culture where Superiors were challenged
** Leaders should only say “what”
*** Not "how"!

* *Timeline - Development of Management Systems* 
** 1800's - Auftragstaktiek (von Moltke)
** 1950's - Management by Objectives (Peter Drucker)
** 1960's - Hoshin Kanri (Japan)
** 1970's - Intel (Andy Grove)
*** Operation Crush
*** Where John Doerr learnt to use OKRs
** 1990's - Balanced Scorecard (Robert Kaplan / Norton)
** 1999 - John Doerr introduces OKRs to Google
*** Google adopted it throughout the organization
*** Now they are being used all over the World in various organizations and industries

===== So OKR's are & aren’t new…

* *SMART Goals - Peter Drucker*
** S - Specific
*** Objectives you can measure through key results
** M - Measurable
*** Key Results cover this!
** A - Achievable
*** Yes & No! They need to be ambitious
** R - Relevant
*** Passion
** T - Time Bound
*** Often bound to a quarter

* *What's different is the approach & culture*
** Focus on self management / leadership
** Set collaboratively and not top down

* *OKRs vs. MbO*
* Top Down
* Company Goals are sum of individual goals
* Goals cascade down
* Target Agreement Meetings
** “You need to sell €X… by the end of the year!”
** Can lead to silo, individualist thinking
* Often Bureaucratic Procedures
* Lots of Admin!

* *OKRs vs. KPI's*
** OKRs
*** Aggressive goals and steps to get there…
*** About reaching  new “heights”
**** or putting something new in place
*** Challenge your team / organization to achieve “moon shots”
*** Change Oriented
*** Provide direction and goals around which your team can align
*** Use OKRs to lead…
*** What to accomplish
*** And how to get there
** KPI's
*** Performance Metrics of people, organization, systems etc.
*** Typically obtainable
*** Represent output of system already in place
*** Don’t necessarily provide context and…
**** Purpose
**** Path
**** Progress

===== But what makes OKRs special?

* *Culture eats strategy for breakfast!*
** You need the right culture in order for OKRs to work
** We need a "Powerful People" Culture
** It's all about the right culture!

* *Speed & Resilience of Trust*

* *Grow & Support an “Experimental” Culture*

* *Train Model*

* *No Silver Bullet!*
** Doesn't replace...
*** Sound Judgement
*** Strong Leadership
*** Creative Workplace Culture


===== Characteristics of OKR's
* *Motivational Tool Quote*
** Important, Optimize, Tradeoffs
* *Focus Quote*
* *Ambitious*
** Need courage, often goals are uncomfortable
* *Measureable*
** Focus on impact
** Make them easy to measure numerically
** (Google uses a scale of 0 - 1.0, but use what’s appropriate!)
* *Key Results can build on each other...*
* *Open & Transparent*
** See what everyone is working on!
** Make it easily accessible
*** On the wall next to the team
*** Single Miro Board for all Teams?
* *Good Results: 60%-70%*
* *Use low grades as data*
* Low grades are data that help refine the next OKRs
** Iterative changes, like a spiral staircase move us upward!
* *Not an employee evaluation tool*
* *Not a shared todo list*

===== OKR superpowers needed to succeed!

* *1. Focus & Commitment*
** Discipline & Prioritization
** Difficult to say “no” to a good idea
** When everyone has agreed to a goal, saying no doesn’t become a political debate
** But a response to a commitment everyone has made

* *2. Align & Connect for Teamwork*
** Once the organization has a clear focus & how it will measure success
** Easier for teams and individuals to align their work around these goals
** Use key results as objectives for specific teams or individuals
** Cascade as much as you need to!
** Two important questions to setup a system of shared objectives
** Where do we want to go?
** This gives us the objective
** How will we pace ourselves and monitor our progress on the way to our destination?
** This will provide the key results
** Reference: High Output Management (Andy Grove)

* *3. Track for Accountability*
** OKRs should be public in the organization
** Everyone should know what the goals are in the organization
** Regularly meet to discuss progress
** These meetings also help to find out if the goals still make sense

* *4. Stretch for Amazing*
** Just beyond the reach of what’s possible
** Seems dangerous
** Are we setting ourselves up for failure?
** HOWEVER
** Big goals attract the best people and create exciting places to work
** You often have amazing progress even if you don’t quite reach your goals
** What’s the key?
** Understanding and communicating stretch goals
** Thresholds of success
** Google aims for at least 70%, 100% is amazing
** Stretch goals are the foundation for long term “moonshots”

===== Putting OKRs to Work

* *Start with the Business Strategy Canvas or Product Vision Board*
** Set LOALS's or MOAL's - Long Term / Mid-Term
*** Set a basket of metrics

* *Set Objectives for the next Quarter*
** First Create a List and Prioritize
** Pick a maximum of the 3 prioritized objectives
*** More leads to over-extended teams and diffusion of effort
** Avoid expressions that don’t push for new successes
*** E.g. keep doing X, maintain market position…
** Use expressions that convey endpoints and states
** Use tangible, objective, and unambiguous terms
*** Should be obvious for a casual observer whether an objective has been reached or not

* *Define Key Results for each Objective*
** 3 Key Results per Objective
** Measurable milestones which directly advance the objective
** Describe outcomes, not activities
** Evidence of Completion should be:
*** Available
*** Credible
*** Discoverable

* *Yearly Flow*
** At the start of the Year...
** Review previous years MOALs
** Run a Retrospective for Kaizen
*** Continuous Improvement
** Set Yearly SMART Goals
** At the start of the Quarter
*** Review Quarter’s OKRs
*** Run a Retrospective
*** Plan the next Quarter’s OKRs
*** 2 - 4 Hour Session(s)

* *Use in conjunction with other systems*

* *Option of a large agile / PDCA process*

* *Team OKRs*
** Organization OKRs first
** How many levels (per division, business units etc.)
** Mix of Organizational and Team Objectives with at least one link
** Questions
*** Alignment between team and org. priorities?
*** Organization more likely to succeed due to team OKRs?
*** Items missing that rest of org. Thinks this team should be working on?
*** More than three priorities?

===== OKR Anti-Patterns

* *Not spending time on the culture*
** Looking just to implement the process

* *Miscommunicating stretch goals*
** Especially if you have interdependent teams

* *Business as usual OKRs*
** Watch value versus effort of Backlog - push for high value & effort

* *Sandbagging*
** Teams that easily reach goals without using everyone in their teams (hoarding resources)

* *Low-value objectives*

* *Perfect vs. Set of Metrics*

* *Insufficient key results for objectives*
** Cause delays of both the discovery of the resource requirements as well as the discovery that the objective will not be completed on schedule


===== Prioritizing OKRs

* *Impact versus Effort Matrix*

* *Amongst Others*
** RICE
** WSJF
** ...

===== Implementing OKRs with A3
* *Step from Goal setting to implementation…*
** Helps you to really understand the issue and a structured approach to addressing it

* *A3 Template*
** An A3 encompasses an OKR

* *Works well with an agile process*
** A3 feeds well into a scrum process

===== TODO

* *OKRs don't need Cadence*?
