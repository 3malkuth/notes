I think we have all struggled at some time or another to decide on what takes priority in our lives or what task we should do first.
In this day and age where we have so many options and distractions it's difficult to chart your course towards your desired future.
One of the skills one will need to master to reach your dreams is that of effectively setting goals, working towards them and tracking your progress.

Why do we need goals?i

The question has always been do we want to allow life to happen to us or for us to shape the outcome of our lives in some manner?
About being proactive or reactive.


In this video series we are going to look at a goal setting framework that has helped the likes of google and intel to beomce competitive and effective organizations on the world stage.
Of course we are talking about OKRs or Objective Key-Results.

So what are OKRs?

OKRs, which stands for Objectives and Key Results, is a goal-setting methodology that has been adopted by organizations such as Google, LinkedIn, and X (Twitter).
The concept of OKRs revolves around setting objectives and defining key results to measure progress towards those objectives.

An objective represents what you want to achieve, while key results are measurable outcomes that indicate progress or success.
For example, if your objective is to increase user engagement, key results could include metrics such as the number of active users or the average time spent on your platform.

The power of OKRs lies in their simplicity and clarity.
They provide a framework for setting ambitious yet achievable goals and aligning teams towards a common purpose.
By implementing OKRs, organizations can foster focus, unity, and velocity in their pursuit of success.
