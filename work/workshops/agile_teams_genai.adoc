= High Performing Agile Teams with GenAI

----
Discover. The first diamond helps people understand, rather than simply assume, what the problem is. It involves speaking to and spending time with people who are affected by the issues.

Define. The insight gathered from the discovery phase can help you to define the challenge in a different way.

Develop. The second diamond encourages people to give different answers to the clearly defined problem, seeking inspiration from elsewhere and co-designing with a range of different people.  

Deliver. Delivery involves testing out different solutions at small-scale, rejecting those that will not work and improving the ones that will.

== Discovery
* Product Owners using GenAI to do quick mock ups
** e.g. figma mockups
*** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjzHusey0_4

* Scientific experimentation
** https://sakana.ai/evolutionary-model-merge/

== Product Vision & Strategy

== Product Roadmap

== Product Backlog

== Create Stories with acceptance tests

== Development

* Give chatgpt some context
** As a...
** I want to...
** So that I can...
** we want to develop the app in a test driven approach
* Ask chatgpt to start with a test list
** Feedback the test list starts with too many big steps
*** We ask ChatGPT to break it down into smaller steps
* Create first unit test and using the following module name (python)
** Create associated implementation code
* Run code in IDE
** If there are errors, feedback the errors into ChatGPT
** if it cannot fix the code, you need to do it and post back into chatgpt
* Learnings
** You got to do baby steps with ChatGPT as the LLM starts to hallucinate very quickly
*** Be careful ChatGPT can also do some very sketchy mocking to make its code work

== Debugging / Refactoring
* CodeGPT
** Tell to use your own hosted AI
** Can tell it to refactor specific code
** You need to trigger it
** Don't have the context of the whole repository
* Tabi - habe nicht so gut funkz.
** Lokal Hosted - zu langsam

* TODO
** https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/18/self_hosted_github_copilot/
** https://tabby.tabbyml.com/
** Copilot test with codespaces
** IntelliJ - Jetbrains AI assist
** Create your own AI helper tool

== Creating test / demo environment??

== Use GenAI to get insghts from feedback data
* When you launch a product increment and get feedback data (test, image etc.)
* Feed into the LLM and see if there are insights it gets for you
* Clean up the data and reformat for processing / visualization

== Technical Documentation

* https://martinfowler.com/articles/2023-tech-author-portrait.html

== Reviews
* Ask ChatGPT to prepare the content / slide deck for a demo for you
** Also ask to create visuals / pictures if need to be to improve the design

== Future
* Devin.AI
** AI developer that builds, measures, learns
* LLM's doing science
** https://sakana.ai/evolutionary-model-merge/
* LLM's are not creative
** It's a tool not a human replacement yet
* We haven't reached AGI yet
