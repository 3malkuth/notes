=== 1. Introduction to the Product Vision Board and Product Section (5 minutes)
- **Purpose**: Briefly introduce the Product Vision Board and the importance of the Product section.
- **Talking Points**:
  - The Product section of the Product Vision Board captures what the product is, its key features, and what makes it unique.
  - This section is crucial because it defines how the product will meet user needs and stand out in the market.
  - Today, we’ll explore these aspects by creating a physical "Product Box" that represents our product.

=== 2. The Product Box Challenge (35 minutes)
- **Purpose**: Engage participants in a creative exercise to define and visualize the product's key features and unique selling points.
- **Activity**: Teams create a "Product Box" that showcases the product’s essential features, benefits, and value propositions.

- **Instructions**:
  - Divide participants into small groups. Each group receives a cardboard box (or large sheet of paper to fold into a box shape) and craft supplies.
  - Imagine that the product is a physical item being sold in a store. The challenge is to design the packaging—specifically, the box it would come in.
  - The box should highlight the product's key features, unique selling points, and the main benefits it offers to users. 

- **Sections to Include on the Product Box**:
  - **Front**: The product name, slogan, and an eye-catching image or logo.
  - **Back**: Key features and benefits—why should someone choose this product?
  - **Sides**: Any additional information, such as testimonials, usage scenarios, or market differentiators.

- **Creative Prompts**:
  - What would make someone pick up this box from a shelf?
  - What are the top 3 features that would be highlighted on the front of the box?
  - How would you convince someone that this product is better than the competition?
  - If the product were a bestseller, what would the customer reviews say?

=== 3. Sharing and Feedback (15 minutes)
- **Purpose**: Share the product boxes and gather feedback from the group.
- **Activity**: Presentations and discussion.

- **Instructions**:
  - Each group presents their product box to the rest of the participants, explaining the features, benefits, and unique selling points they chose to highlight.
  - After each presentation, open the floor for feedback and questions from the other groups.
  - Encourage participants to think about how well the box communicates the product’s value and what could be improved.

=== 4. Wrap-Up and Final Thoughts (5 minutes)
- **Purpose**: Reflect on the key takeaways and next steps.
- **Activity**: Group reflection and closing remarks.

- **Steps**:
  - Summarize the key features and unique value propositions identified during the activity.
  - Discuss how these insights will be integrated into the Product Vision Board and influence the product’s development.
  - Conclude by reinforcing the importance of clearly defining the product’s value and differentiation in the market.

=== Follow-Up
- **Document the Product Box Ideas**: Capture the key features, benefits, and unique selling points identified during the workshop and add them to the Product section of the Product Vision Board.
- **Incorporate into Product Development**: Use these insights to guide the product development process, ensuring that the product delivers on its promises and stands out in the market.
