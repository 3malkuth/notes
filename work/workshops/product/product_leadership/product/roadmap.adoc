==== Product Roadmap

* *Introduction - Why are we talking about this topic?*
* Example - Roadtrip
** You can have a clear vision of the future and a good strategy
** But won't guarantee success!
** You need to describe the journey you want to take the product on
** Develop and actionable plan to deliver the strategy
*** ... you need a roadmap

* *What is a Roadmap?*
** Vividly describes how a product will grow and develop over time
** Step by Step
** Time-Scale

* *Benefits*
** *Benefit - Continuity of Purpose*
*** Continuity of Purpose beyond the next few features releases or iterations
*** Common time frame is 12 Months
** *Strategy Implementation*
*** How the product strategy will be implemented
*** Bridges the gap between strategy and execution  
** *Aligns Stakeholders and Development Teams*
*** Ensuring we all move in the same direction e.g. sales and development
** *Simplifies the Backlog*
*** Directs / Unburdens the Backlog with long term detail
** *Development Budget*
*** Helps you acquire one
** *Strategic Decisions Tool*
*** Over time may become your main tool for making strategic decisions

* *Anti-Agile?*
** It is neither, depends how you use it...
** Stop using feature based roadmaps and focus on goal oriented roadmaps
*** Rather outcome based roadmaps that don't say when a feature will be available
**** But describes the specific benefits a product should create
** Involve the key stakeholders and developers in updating the plan
*** People feel they have a say and are involved in the process
*** More likely to have a realistic plan that flows at a sustainable pace
** Ensure the Backlog and Roadmap are kept in Sync
