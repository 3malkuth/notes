==== WSJF

===== Shorts Script
WSJF, or Weighted Shortest Job First, is a prioritization technique that helps you decide what initiative or task to do first.
It is calculated by divding the "Cost of Delay" by "Job Duration".
The "Cost of Delay" can be computed by summing the following elements: User-Business Value, Time Criticality, Risk Reduction and/or Opportunity Enablement.

How do you find values for these elements?
Simply use the adjusted Fibonacci scale.
