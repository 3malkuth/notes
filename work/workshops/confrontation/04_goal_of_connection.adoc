==== Own the Goal of Connection

* *Goal is to repair and strengthen connection*
** Each person responsible for that goal
** Let's talk about the attitude or posture we need to pursue this goal
*** And how do we priotize and fight for connection in the midst of conflict

* *Recap: when we come into a confrontation...*
** The emotions are flowing...
** People are feeling upset
*** Often, initially, one is more upset than the other
*** But that changes quickly

* *Where your connection is tested*
** Often shocked at how weak the connection is
** Because I have sent the message
*** I am more interested in preserving myself
*** Than in preserving our connection
** It doesn't matter if at work, in life...

* *I've said and done things that create distance*
** That break the connection...
** Because I didn't own my personal goal of owning this connection
*** Through the confrontation
** I am going to use this to strengthen our bond
** I choose to bring this attitude with me

* *What attitude am I bringing?*

* *Anger with the goal of disconnection?*

* *Gentleness with the Goal of  Connection*
** Come with a gentle attitude
** Show people your goal is connection
** Show them you have no need to control them

** Galatians 6:1
*** When someone has made a mistake or trespassed
*** You who know the Father
*** You who are spiritual
*** Go to that person in a spirit of gentleness
*** Meaning I have come to you to show you the Father
**** My goal is connection
**** I have zero need to control you

* *This is a tough posture to have!*
** Helps me to reduce anxiety
** If you come to me with a confrontation
*** I think you are trying to change me
*** You're trying to control me
*** I think your perspective or position is more important to you than I am
*** Then my anxiety begins to climb
*** I find myself entering a self preservation mode

* *Helpful trigger... "My goal is connection"!*
** Watch how your anxiety will drop!
** I will remember all these things I need to do to protect connection
*** Rather than protecting my argument
** Personal commitment is to that connection
** What helps us to elevate love above the issue
** Helps me prioritize that we have a relationship to protect over 
** How confrontation is going to help my relationships

* *Courage*
** For many, you are going to need this mindset and tooling to find the courage to confront
** The mindset of "Confrontation is a way for me to build stronger connections"
** I have the goal of connection and I can use this intensity to weld connections even deeper

* *The Art of Listening*
** Because I am focused on the connection in the relationship
** What I need is a posture of listening
---
** If I come with the heart of the Father
** ... in the Spirit of Gentleness
---
** Lots of listening skills needed here
** Lots of paying attention to whats going on with that person
** The better I get at listening
*** Better information I have
*** Better Decisions I can make
** I am going to practice finding out whats going on with that person

* *Initially put my needs aside*
** Not forever, just initially
** Seek first to understand

* *What's going on?*
** Start looking and trying to understand what the person is feeling
** Ask them "What's going on?"
** I want to get them talking
** I've come with the goal of connection

* *Job of Listener*
** I will assume the posture of listener if thats necessary
*** I will take that job as we need a listener and a speaker
** Too often we come as speaker and expect the other to immediately become the listener
** Can be OK
** But at some point thats got to change
** I need to know what you need by me becoming a listener
** Whatever happens first is less important
*** More important is that I have redied myself to become a listener

* *Even when...*
** You are saying things I don't agree with or understand or that could offend
** I am listening past my offense, fear, not understanding
*** Throughout intense back and forth my goal is connection
** I need to know what your feeling
** I see your upset
** Help me understand what you're upset about

* *Assist with words and your posture*
** Allow the person to speak
** You came in here and said this and that and wanted to start a fight with me
** You say, "OK, so you feel suprised, scared that I am going to hurt you..."
** Listening, listening, listening so that I can get words on this section of it
** So I can help you... maybe I caught you off guard or you are not able to to...
** But I am going to help you turn your feelings into words
** I am going to do this for you...
** So I am going to say... I hear you say you are feeling hurt?
*** OR... I hear you saying thatg the process I introduced felt shocking...
*** and you feel powerless in it
*** this is happening to you... is that what your saying?
*** OK
*** In my posture I've come to listen, learn, understand
*** That's what I brought with me
** Now I need the same from you!
*** I am going to doa good job of...
*** I already know what I am feeling
*** and I am going to tell you what I need
*** I helped you articulate your feelings, and your needs
*** I am now going to communicate the same to you

* *This back and forth process...*
** Is built to benefit both players
** It's built set each other up for success
** Built for 2 powerful people in exchange
