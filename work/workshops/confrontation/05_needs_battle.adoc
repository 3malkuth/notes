==== The Battle of the Needs

* *Introduction*
** Want to talk today about the Battle of the Needs
** We've talked a lot about getting to the needs
** How important they are
** Talked a lot about understanding the person in front of you
*** Also what they need

* *Seems one person's needs are the most important!*
** Seems that one player has a more important need than the other one
** They can tend to flood the conversation with their needs
** While the other one stays unaware
*** Keep's serving that one person's needs
*** Cause they keep demanding
** If you keep this up, you are building a disrespectful exchange

* *If we have a situation*
** Kids, money, work schedule or performance, friends...
** There will always be 2 sets of needs
** One may be louder
** But doesn't make the other one go away
** Person may hide the need,
*** but doesn't make it illegitimate
*** doesn't mean its not at work creating anxiety

* *Resentment can build up*
** Over time the one or other just become resentful
** Builds up in the relationship
** Because of unmet needs

* *Dangerous! Becomes a culture!*
** Becomes an subconcious understanding
** Your needs matter and mine don't
** Until I hate you!
** Now I am going to punish and undermine you!
** This so called righteous call to punish eats away in the person
*** And in the relationship
** As we only focused all this time just on solving one need!

* *Build a solution meeting both needs!*
** As we grow in confrontation and mature in relationship
** We must think about both needs
** We've learned how to get at the needs of both people
** We bring them to surface in any conversation / conflict
** We build a solution addressing both needs
*** Not just one or the other

* *We don't take turns addressing a need!*
** Seek to build solutions that meet both needs

* *Send message of respect and honour"
** Now we send a message of honour and respect back and forth
*** Saying, "My needs matter and so do yours!"

* *Goal: Plan to meet your needs and mine*
** I'm not satisfied walking away from this interaction
** Without coming up with a plan to meet your needs and mine

** I want to introduce a model
** Only 3 things to remember
*** LISTEN
*** SERVE
*** ADJUST

* *Listen*
** Talked about listening already
** Take on this posture
** Best listener wins
** One who listens the best first wins
** As they have enough information to know what to do
** Can take a posture of leadership
*** In finding how to meet both needs
** I have listened well
** I understand yours and mine needs...

* *Serve*
** Now I have the information of the needs
** I am going to send you a message of service
** I am looking to communicate that...
*** I am looking at ways to supply your needs in this relationship
** Communicate, "I am here to serve"

* *Serve!?*
** Usually here people are afraid
** What if they are manipulative and trying this or that...
** Calm down! Understand this!

* *Nobody can control you*
** Thats the truth!
*** If this is the case, then you need to address this in your life
** re-visit the idea of a "powerful person"
** People can be manipulative, but it only works if both party's agree on manipulation
** As long as I can manage myself
** I am not afraid of being controlled by you
** My anxiety doesn't spike when I feel you are trying to get me to do something

* *Communciate feeling of manipulation*
** You can even say,"I feel manipulated when you act like this..."
** I need to feel powerful, respected etc. as we resolve this
** Now they have some good information
*** And you are back to managing yourself again

* *Back to the message*
** I want you to know that I want to serve and address what you need from me

* *Adjust*
** I am a learner willing to grow
** I am willing to adjust
** I am willing to change my behaviour to meet your need
** I can do things differently as soon as I know what it is I need to change

* *If you have...*
** A "love" language
** An area where you are feeling anxiety when I do...
** Example of back seat driving with a fast driver

* *Adjust to protect our connection*
** I am willing to serve and adjust to protect our connection
** Example of the many powerful people accomplishing much at Bethel
** Strong players all wanting to get their way
** Danny & Kris at lunch had a confrontation that everyone else witnessed
** The people did not enjoy seeing the disconnection play out
** They confronted Danny - this is not fun for us
** I will go and ask Kris how he is experiencing me
*** I don't feel disconnected, bitter or resentful
** Danny said,"Kris, did you feel dishonoured, disrespected or punished by me?"
** "No! I thought we were having a great conversation..."
** "Me too, but we scared everyone at the table while we were doing it..."
** Both said I am good...
** He met with Paul and Dan and said that he had talked with Kris and both were fine, but the questions was are they good?
** They both said thank you for listening and being willing to adjust

* *Protecting Covenants*
** This is what we are doing... protecting covenants
** In these conversations they are not under our control how they turn out
** Can't determine outcome

* *But we can have a plan for us!*
** I can grow into someone who is willing to own my goal of connection
** Willing to learn to listen well
** Not afraid of intense / negative emotion
*** In me or in you
** You don't need to bring a bazooka to our conversation
*** As I am going to listen well!
** Will let you influence me as I will listen and take it in
** I will be affected by whats going on with you

* *We get good at...*
** Negotiations and business deals
** Dealing with objective info
** Our professional conflicts, confrotnations and spaces

* *But then we go home...*
** Often frustrated as it doesn't work there

* *Works opposite way round*
** I get good at working on my relationship in my marriage, with my children...
** You aren't necessarily going to agree with everyone in your family
** But I do send a message, you are more important to me than this disagreement
** Our relationship is more important to me than being right or winning
** I am going to work on these relationships close to me and do them well
** The I will be successful out there in the world
*** In my business dealings with customers, suppliers, employees
** I will grow a skill set that moves from the family out

* *They are different*
** The problem with being successful out there and bringing in into the family...
** They are different!
** This is intimate and honest
** Out there are temporary relationships that are often win-win
*** But they go away

* *Family Relationships are...*
** Learn, Grwo, find the best me thats in there
*** And try it out

* *Thank you!*
** I hope this will add years to your life
