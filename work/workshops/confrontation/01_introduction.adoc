==== Introduction
* All relationships face issues that need to be confronted
** In Family, Business, Politics, Community... all of life

* How do we ensure these issues don't escalate in a major conflict?

** We need to gain the tools necessary to reduce the anxiety others face
** And help to reach understanding

* Word to confront
** The word "confrontation" refers to a direct and often face-to-face encounter or conflict between individuals, groups, or ideas.
** It typically involves a situation in which opposing views, interests, or actions come into contact, leading to a clash, argument, or dispute.
** 2 people face to face discussing an issue
** Isaiah 1:18
*** Come let us reason together
** We are bringing attention to a relational issue that needs to be adjusted
** There needs to be understanding
** There is something here out of joint
** We need to take time to adjust
** Talk about this issue "face to face"

* We are bringing together 2 very different people
* We would like an easy 5 steps or formula
** Do this, it will work every time
* It doesn't work that way

* However I have some dynamics or examples for you that can help
* For these situations it's crucial that you know who is standing in front of you
* U need to know what are they feeling & their needs
* How did they get to this point?
* Most people have a predictable set of perceptions
** And behavioural responses to those perceptions
* This is something you can learn and anticipate
** And can build into how you handle conflict

* People respond differently right out of the gate
** Same situation, but they feel something completely different
** Need something totally different from another person
** No right or wrong answer / approach as we have different needs
* If I can get at what you need, I can help reduce the anxiety
** And bring about the best result here
* The more you talk you may realise that the other person themselves doesn't understand or is not able to articulate their needs

* the word confrontation is associated with so much pain as we have wasted so much time battling it out with people we didn't understand
* So we are gonig to take some time to discuss these confrontation dynamics we need to uncover, understand and apply to the success of our conflict conversations

* *Goal of Confrontation*
** To create connection and not to create division
