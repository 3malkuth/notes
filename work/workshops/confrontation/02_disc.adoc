* Introduce the 4 Needs  
** *Dominant - Respect, Results, Resolve*
*** Don't be disrespectful
*** If you are disrespectful they are immediately triggered and then you face the anger
*** They want results and will not calm down until they get it
*** Need resolve - they needs these conflicts to be resolved
*** They run to the battle, to the conflict

*** they are trying to get their needs met to resolve the situation (Take the initiative)

** *Influencer - Understood (Affirmed)*

*** I just need ot know you are giving me that credit even though we have a problem
*** I is agitated really out of a fear of being rejected
*** Important that you understand that I am good
*** I would never come at you and do something nasty to u (I am a good person)
*** That helps me bring the best me

** *Steadfast - Connection*
*** Make sure you aren't a jerk when coming into conflict with these people
*** They Avoid confrontation for a long time
*** Like charcoal they will absorb other people's problems, stuff, junk
*** Never come out with it because they are so intent on protecting relationships
*** Seeking to stay connected
*** Rather than stading up for their rights
**** they need to be taught that
*** More likely to step back and allow things to go by
*** Because they need to feel connected
*** they are in this to get the connection back

** *Conscientious - Information*
*** Lots of information
*** We are doing this right
*** That I am  doing this right, I am "right"
*** Strength of character
*** Pursuing righteousness
*** Classically if you find yourself in a disagreeement with a "C"
*** You are probably wrong...
*** They do their homework, they come prepared
*** They too have prolonged this confrontation (would prefer to run)
**** There must be something else I can do
**** I am trying to find out if I have done something wrong
**** It is so agitating for them
*** If you recognize they are trying to get it right and help them settle in
**** You will end up with a completely different person

* So when we talk about face to face confrontation...
** it's so important you know what's behind the face!
** Whats motivating that person to even be in this conversation
*** What they are feeling (seen on the surface)
*** But importantly what do they need?
** How can you supply the need to change the emotion for the person in the confluict
** It's the same for you
*** Do you know whats going on inside of you? Feelings and needs!
*** So you can show the person!
*** This is what I am feeling, but if we can get past the feelings to discussing and resolving both our needs, this will help us protect our relationship.

* As we go through this series I want you to become good at getting at these needs by becoming a student of your needs and of others and taking the time toinvest in this process.
