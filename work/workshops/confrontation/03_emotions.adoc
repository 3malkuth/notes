==== Emotions
* Confrontations are successful when they are safe
* How do we create a safe place for the exchange of truth by managing our emotions
** so we don't bring a display of anger and defensiveness
** But a vulnerable expression of the pain, fear, or powerlessness we are experiencing
** and the emotional needs we have in the relationship

* *At the start of a confrontation...*
** Do you get a defensive response?
** Do you yourself get defensive?
** End up in situations where people don't expect to be listened to...
*** So they approach with a Bazooka (upset, intense, oftne disrespectful)
**** THAT triggers the defensive responses in them or you...

* *Are you bringng a Bazooka or Badmington Racket?*
** Intensity is rooted in the question... "How easy is this going to be?"
*** is there going to be an ease or respect in this conversation
*** OR do I have to try and convince you I am valuable and worth listening to?
**** ...my perspective is accurate, or do I have to convince you that I am right
** AS SOON AS THIS STARTS THERE IS NO CONVERSATION; BUT A MONOLOGUE
*** We can basically stand back to back and shout into the void as no one is listening!
** The big break down in our conversation is around INTENSITY and DEFENSIVENESS

* *Do you know whats going on inside of you...?*
** When you come to this type of conversation
** Do you know how to show someobody whats going on?
** If you don't this is a pretty serious deficit on your part
** This is part of the problem you are adding to the break down in the confrontation

* *Take a minute to ask yourself this question...?*
** do I know how to identify what I am feeling when I feel upset?
** Do I know the emotion?
** Can I put a name tag on it (a word on it)?
** We all know when a child is upset...
*** They behave their emotions as they don't have the words for it e.g. throwing their toys around
*** Children have no words for their emotions so they behave them
** When you have a 30 year old behaving their emotions that is not childish that is a problem (destructive, illegal)
** Part of our maturity as people is that we learn to put a word on our emotions
** Do you know how you are feeling?. Can you identify that feeling with a Word?

* *Most of us don't know how to put a word on our feelings*
** Either OK or ENRAGED - I'll be OK as soon as you stop enraging me
** This is not the truth - You are not making me angry...
** This situation has brought to the surface a bunch of emotions
*** I don't know how to communicate them
*** I don't know how to identify them
*** I don't know how to be powerful if I feel this much negative emotion

* *Take some time and learn*
** This is where I have to grow and become the adult here (take some time and learn)
* "All models are wrong, but some are useful." George Box
** Print out some charts and try using the words

** Get a list and print them out
** "Practice makes perfect" ;-)
*** Don't park in the A's
** In summary, get vocabulary for these feelings
** Once you can label them they become something you can order
*** You get more control over your emotions once you can begin to articulate them

* *Basic Emotions*
** Basic emotions you can use to quickly narrow down what you are feeling
*** Great for starting out with kids as well...
** Helpful at first to identify what you are feeling before moving onto a deeper articulation of emotions
** Glad, Sad, Mad, Egad!
*** e.g. I'm not angry, but sad and upset because...
*** If I just jump to angry or if all my emotions are simply labeled as anger...
*** Then I am triggering people's defences when actually I am wanting them to move towards me (not away)

* *Anger, Powerless, Pain, Happiness*
** Powerless is one of the emotions that often goes unrecognized
** People often identify powerless as something else
** if you identify this, you have the chance to see this as a cue
*** If I am feeling powerless, the question is, "What do I become powerful with?"
*** Do I become powerful by controlling other people or by controlling myself?
*** THIS SHOULD ALWAYS BE THE GOAL! HOW DO I CONTROL MYSELF?

* *Real Fear: Being Hurt!*
** We get defensive, but the real fear is we are going to get hurt!
*** Punishment, rejection
** I'm afraid of this going really bad
** You seem really upset, I really care about you, but I don't know if we are going to fail here...
*** Not sure whats going to happen here!
** We've been through this, we've avoided this because of what happened last time

* *Back to I am going to manage myself...*
** By identifying what I am feeling and I am going to put a word on it
** This is my best effort, this is my contribution, this is me managing myself so that I can create a safe place
** I am going to build a round me a spot for you to do the same thing
** I am going to identify what I feel
** I am going to own what I feel
** I am going to communicate what I feel
** What's next is I will get at what I need
** But wha's sitting on the surface are all these feelings
*** Upset / Angry doesn't really get at, so I will go deeper to get at the real feelings I am experiencing
**** e.g. hurst, scared, powerless
** I am going to master it and get better and better at it as we go along

* *Keep this as simple as you can*
** there are many books and processes on this topic
*** But you will probably never remember these in the moment due to their complexity
** In the intensity of it all, we are not going to remember many things

* *Basic Process: Step 1 - Label the emotion, creating a safe space*
** I am going to put a label on my emotion, I am going to own it, not blame it
** You are not making me mad, sad,powerless... I own my emotions, you don't control what is going on inside here
** On a good day I do...

* *Basic Process: Step 2 - Then I am going to show it with a word and not with behaviour*
** In so doing I create a safe place for you to share what you are feeling
*** I may ask, "Are you feeling hurt, powerless...?"
*** This is a safe place for you to share
** We're gonna keep it simple
** Two powerful owners, face-to-facce talking about an issue
*** There's going to be some adjustment going on
** Both of us are committed to the adjustment

* *Keep the conversation relevant to the situation*
** Don't dig up the past!
** Back then, you did... and this is what happened 10 years ago...
** You're always like this...
** KEEP FOCUSED on the SITUATION (Something happened here and now...)
*** We are communicating about this and not dragging in the past

* *Communicate Commitment*
** We are going to stay intent on a resolution that is going to help
** Re-build our relationship
** Our relationship heal if its been torn
** Our relationship strengthen and move ahead

* *Basic Process: Step 3 - Identify and communicate the need*
** And we (as a group or individual) are going to be dedicated to addressing the need (determined)
** And I am going to identify, articulate and communicate my need as best as possible
** The more I practice, the more effective I will become at getting to it quickly
** The following is an example of the way I talk because of practice...
*** I need to feel valuable, respected, powerful in our relationship.
*** Unfortunately, I don't when you accuse me, when you don't listen and come with that bazooka.
*** I want to hear you, but I feel scared because you brought no honour or respect to the conversation.

* *Basic Process: Step 4 - As soon as the need is addressed...*
** Emotions are going to change as soon as the need is addressed
** It's the same with you!
** You brought your needs to me
** As soon as I adjust and address your needs, your emotions are going to change

* When our needs are addressed...
** We are standing in a place of resolve!
** We don't have anger, fear etc. anymore!
** What we have is comfort!
** We've worked in that trust cycle

* Result - We were able to communicate the need for an adjustment
** That adjustment led to a need being met
** And then there is comfort
** That cycle between 2 people or groups of people begins to build trust
** Each and every time we have a confrontation it leads to a stronger and deeper relationship
*** We are able to be more open and vulnerable with each other

* *Thats the Goal*
** Nourish, Develope, Mature the relationship between 2 powerful people
** Not to win
** Not to judge
** Not to punish
** Not to find a bad guy
** Not to be a victim
** Goal is to help 2 powerful people or groups deepen their bond through trust

* Bible says mature love chases away fear
** This becomes the process
** The process is to build trust by sharing the truth (refer to the relationship 101 course)

* Powerlessness like fear etc.
** Often covered by anger
** I feel powerless to change you / the situation
** I want that control, I want it to change!
** So I feel powerless
** So I get good at communicating powerlessness and not anger
** Addressing the anger won't address the real need / issue

* Bazooka's are only needed when you feel you have to break through a big wall
** However, if you have addressed the emotions and cretaed a safe place
** You can play Badmington with the issue and move towards the goal of addressing the real needs
** And building trust and connection

* Get practicing and we will see you next time!
