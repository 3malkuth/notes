=== Team Forming - Introduction


==== What is team forming?
So what is team forming exactly?

*Understanding Team Forming*
Ever wondered what team forming is all about? It's essentially the process of shaping a group of individuals into an effective, collaborative team. Let's break it down step by step.

*Starting with an Idea & a Sponsor*
It all begins with an idea. A stakeholder or sponsor recognizes a need that calls for a dedicated team. This could be a new product or initiative they're ready to invest in.

*Gathering a Group*
To fulfill this need, we need people—a team with diverse skills and perspectives. These individuals come together to work on the identified goal.

*Setting the Platform for Collaboration*
Now, here's the crucial part. In team forming, we don't just throw people together; we take the time to understand the team's purpose, the roles each member plays, the values they share, and the desired ways of working together. This sets the stage for a well-established, collaborative team.

==== Why do we invest in team forming?
* *Bad Start:* It's hard for a team to recover from a bad start
* *Uniting strategy, execution and core values:* The team is focused on what is needed to satisfy customers
* *Alignment:* of business people and developers ensuring everyone understands what is needed to be done
* *Before the pressure begins:* A group gets the chance to form into a team before the pressure of development work begins
* *Lay a solid foundation:* By laying a solid foundation everyone has a chance to provide their input and perspective on what needs to be accomplished and then begin collaborating
* *Connect & Understand Stakeholder Needs:* The group gets a chance to meet with the different stakeholders and sponsors understanding what each group / person needs from their involvement in the delivering the initiative
* *Establish Team Norms & Standards:* The group has a chance to establish norms for their ways of working together

==== What's the Goal?
* *Achieve Alignment:* Ensuring the team is aligned behind the vision and goals of the stakeholders
* *Build Momentum:* We want the team to grow from strength to strength in productivity and efficacy
* *Clarify Roles:* It's important for all to know exactly the role they play in the team reaching its goals

==== When?
*Before & after a Team is formed:* Even if a team has been working together for some time it still makes sense to do team forming - you will see the positive fruit

===== Shared Vision and Alignment
Research by Hackman and Morris (1990) found that teams with a clear mission and shared understanding of their purpose tend to perform better. A team charter helps establish this shared vision and alignment.

Improved Communication and Collaboration:
Katzenbach and Smith (1993) emphasized the importance of team charters in their book “The Wisdom of Teams.” They found that teams with clear charters exhibit better communication, collaboration, and overall performance.

Clarity of Roles and Responsibilities:
Research by Tuckman (1965) introduced the famous “forming, storming, norming, performing” model. The initial “forming” stage involves creating a team charter to define roles, responsibilities, and norms. Clarity in these areas positively impacts team productivity.
Reference: Tuckman, B. W. (1965). Developmental sequence in small groups. Psychological Bulletin, 63(6), 384–399.
Team Charter as a Commitment Device:
Larson and LaFasto (1989) studied high-performing teams and found that a team charter serves as a commitment device. When team members actively participate in creating the charter, they are more likely to adhere to it, leading to improved productivity.
