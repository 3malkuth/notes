== Vision

=== What?
Let's begin our first section of our purpose category by looking at defining a team's vision.

*Aspirational desired future state*
A vision, articulated in a vision statement, is a forward-looking and aspirational statement that articulates an organization's or team's desired future state. It provides a clear and inspiring picture of what the organization aims to achieve in the long term. A well-crafted vision statement serves as a guiding beacon, motivating and aligning the efforts of individuals within the organization.

*Vision versus Mission*
A vision statement differs from a mission statement in that it focuses on where a team is going whereas a mission statement focuses on why the team exists and how they plan to reach their goals and for whom they are doing the work.
Whereas a mission statement focuses on the present, a vision statement focuses on the future.

=== Examples
Let's take a look at a few examples of vision statements from well known organizations.

Google: "To provide access to the world's information in one click."

Microsoft: "To empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more."

Tesla: "To create the most compelling car company of the 21st century by driving the worldâ€™s transition to electric vehicles."

Take a moment to briefly think about what makes these vision statements so compelling, memorable and impactful?

=== Why does our team need a vision?
You may be asking why does our team need a vision.
Isn't this only something required on an organizational level?

*Direction and Purpose:*
A vision statement provides a clear sense of direction and purpose for the team. It outlines the ideal future state the team aspires to achieve, creating a shared goal that guides decision-making and actions.

*Motivation and Inspiration:*
A well-crafted vision statement inspires and motivates team members. It instills a sense of enthusiasm and commitment by highlighting the positive impact and meaningful outcomes the team seeks to create.

*Alignment of Efforts:*
A vision statement aligns the efforts of team members. It helps everyone understand how their individual contributions contribute to the overall vision, fostering a sense of unity and collaboration.

Strategic Decision-Making:
The vision statement serves as a strategic anchor for decision-making. When faced with choices or challenges, the team can refer to the vision to ensure that decisions align with the long-term goals and aspirations.

Cohesive Team Identity:
A vision statement contributes to the development of a cohesive team identity. It creates a shared narrative that binds team members together, fostering a sense of belonging and pride in the collective purpose.

Employee Engagement and Retention:
Clearly communicated visions contribute to employee engagement and retention. When team members understand and believe in the vision, they are more likely to feel connected to their work and remain committed to the team.

Attraction of Talent:
A compelling vision statement can attract top talent to join the team. Individuals who share the same values and aspirations are more likely to be drawn to a team with a visionary outlook.

=== The benefits a vision statement
Of course one could write a long essay on your vision as a company, but it definitely pays to distill the main idea into a single sentence that is impactful, memorable and concise.

=== Powerful Questions
Let's briefly talk about some powerful questions that can help you to define your vision. here are some examples...

What will the future look like at the end of the project or in a few years?
What positive impact would we have had on our customers, our organization or the world?


=== Attributes of a good vision
A vision focuses on the future, describing the ideal state the organization or team aspires to reach.

It inspires and motivates individuals by communicating a compelling and positive image of the organization's future success.

A vision statement is usually concise and memorable, making it easy for individuals to recall and share.

It aligns with the organization's core values and reflects the principles that guide its actions.

Vision statements often use forward-looking language, emphasizing growth, innovation, and positive change.

While visionary, a good vision statement remains grounded and achievable, setting ambitious goals without being unrealistic.

A vision statement is crafted to resonate with various stakeholders, including employees, customers, partners, and the broader community.

The vision serves as a guide for decision-making and strategic planning, helping the organization stay on course toward its long-term objectives.

=== Vision Statement Checklist
I know thats a lot to consider! Accordingly,I have created a short and simple checklist that can be used in guiding and verifying the completed vision statement a team puts together.

* Future-Oriented
* Inspirational
* Concise and Memorable (One sentence)
* Alignment with Values
* Forward-Looking Language
* Challenging Yet Attainable
* Motivational for Stakeholders
* Guiding Decision-Making

=== How to develop a vision statement
There are several ways to develop a vision statement.
In this section we will look at an approach that I like to use.

I like to start with giving everyone in the team and the stakeholers the option of either drawing or writing down an answer to the following questions:
- Where are we going on this journey together as a team?
- What will the World look/sound/taste/feel like in a few years because of the work we have done as a team
- Who are we becoming?
- What do we want to become?

I ask the participants to make it vivid including colors, sites, smells, tastes, feelings, and sounds.

It is also important that the activity is timeboxed. I would not give them more than 5' to prepare their content.

At the end of the timebox, everyone gets 1'-3' to share what they created.

We follow this by grouping the various inputs together by theme and then you can use a s system like dot voting or consensing to get concensus on the the top three items that should be included in the end statement.

Once these have been deicded on the group works together to formulate the top 3 ideas into a single sentence.

Once you have completed your statement you can run through the checklist to test and see if the vision statement fits the right level of quality.

You may have to go back to the drawing board if the statement is not clear and impactful enough, but try and make sure that you don#t spend more than 30# - 45' on this activity.

=== Final thoughts...
A vision statement is helpful for answering the question "Where?" for a team.
It is helpful if it is concise, memorable and impactful.
It helps to align the team and can help in team decision making processes.
