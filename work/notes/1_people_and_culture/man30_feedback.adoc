=== Management 3.0 - Feedback

== Background: Why are we talking about this problem?
* Giving feedback isn't easy in any context
* How do I give feedback in an authentic way without starting unecessary conflict?

== Delta Definition
=== Current State: Where are we?
* Feedback is either...
** Not given for fear of offence
** Or given poorly and aggressively

=== Future State: Where do we want to be?
* Able to give feedback in a non-aggressive, building up way
** That builds people upa nd helps them to improve
** Without breaking them down
** Helping the person to learn
** Also inspiring them and not de-motivating them

== Analysis: Why does the gap exist?

=== Theme

==== Countermeasures (Options)

* *Feedback Wrap* - Currently a good solution
** Describe your context
** List your observations
** Express your emotions
** Sort Needs By Value
** End with suggestions

== Act: What's the Plan?
[ ] What (Who, By When)
[x] _

== Impact: Review What effect did our actions have?
* Review metrics in light of Delta

== Learn: What was learned (Retro) & do we need to change standards?
* Don't use the feedback praise sandwich
** Seems unauthentic

==== Appendix A: Notes

==== Background
* A key statement from the Agile Manifesto
** Build projects around motivated individuals.
** Give them the environment and support they need,
** and trust them to get the job done.

==== Current State: What often happens...
* C-Level Managers provide strategic direction
** Allow the organization to figure out how
* Middle Management ensure teams have what they need to get the job done in the way they decided to do it
** Goal: Remove Middle Management
** Greater organizational agility removes the need for this role
* Teams in effective organizations don’t need protection from the organization

* Idea of performance reviews as feedback is based on command & control management
* Usually managers control teams through bonuses & raises
** Behaviorist thinking
* Give rewards to reinforce the desired behaviour and punish people by withholding or actively punishing people if they don’t comply

* This thinking is not aligned with autonomous self-managing teams!
** Performance reviews not aligned with the agile culture

* What are typical questions people ask that initiate “Feedback Processes” usually?
** How do we set salaries?
** How do we reward “top performers?”

* Dangers!
* Local Optimization
** local optimization—improving the performance of one part of a larger system—doesn’t work
** That’s a basic principle of the Theory of Constraints (described in The Goal and The Phoenix Project—both are essential reading).”
* Systemic View
** A the team level, what matters is the speed of the entire team!
** Top performers tend to slow down the team because people end up waiting for that person to finish critical work before they can move forward with their own
** These people become bottlenecks who slow down the team (system)
** The speed of the system can’t go faster than the bottleneck

* Underperformers?
** Tech firms don’t hire uneducated, unmotivated, underachievers
** “Underperformance” is not inherent
** These problems are solved by…
*** Training
*** Getting “juniors” to work on challenging tasks
** Not by!
*** Punishing people
*** Low Bonuses
*** Pay cuts
** The team knows…
*** who needs help
** Individual reviews are unnecessary!

* What to do with talent?
** Mentor
** Teach
** Rewarding the entire team, you motivate top performers to help the team get better
** Otherwise
*** Competitive Environment
*** Silos (Local Optimization)
*** Top performers will guard their territory

==== Options / Tools
* Spotify Model
** Create a matrix of criteria together
*** (From the CEO to the intern)
** Fill out your matrix for yourself
** Team Reviews and adjusts together
** If your get a top score you can get a top salary
** Lowest salaries are determined by what a competitor would pay you to get you to join them

* If you have to… (Keep the Old Approach)
** If you still have a management structure and a company culture more conservative and less prone to change,
*** one could focus on feedback as a continuous process…
**** in the context of the whole team where it is assumed the manager is “hands on” and working daily with the team(s)
** What’s the problem with this approach?
*** Individuals aren’t perfect and rewarding individually will ultimately undermine the team effectiveness

* Praise Sandwich
** Praising something about the person you are addressing (positive feedback)
** Pointing out the behaviors-or-results-that-need-improvement (negative feedback)
** Followed by another friendly message to wrap it all up (positive feedback)
** Rather don’t use this…
**** People dislike the praise sandwich because they feel that...
***** Valuable feedback doesn't need to be offered between two insincere compliments
***** And medicine in the middle may go unnoticed if the person only focuses on the praise given

* Feedback Wrap
** Describe your context
** List your observations
** Express your feelings
** Explain the goal / value of the change you desire
** Offer some suggestions on how this goal could be reached
