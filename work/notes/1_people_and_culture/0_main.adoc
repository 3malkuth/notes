== Doing the Ground Work

> Prepare your work outside,
>   and get your fields ready.
>   Afterwards, build your house.
> -- Proverbs 24:27 WEB

One of the mistakes I have made many times is to begin to introduce new ideas and tools without first ensuring the people I am working with have the necessary foundations in place (culture, mindset, ways of thinking, wineskin etc. to carry the changes I want to make.

This is why I don't jump straight into the section on strategy and purpose and begin by making sure that we are aligned around values and associated principles.
