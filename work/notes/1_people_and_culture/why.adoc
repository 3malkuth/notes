=== Start with Why?

Understanding why a team or organization exists needs to be the start of any team / organization forming journey. Simon Sinek has much to say about this topic in his book "Start with Why". He says that if you want to inspire "the market" / customers and the people working for you you need to start with the question "Why?".

Since we are interested in building teams that are intrinsically motivated this is important to ensure they have the necessary motivation to buy into the purpose of the team and to keep working at the challenges they will face even when the "chips are down".
An extrinsic motivator that will also help the team is if the "market" or your customers also truly buy into the why behind what the team is producing and this will give the team the sense that what they are doing is having an impact in the world and they are truly helping to change the world.

=== Creating a "Why" Statement Inspired by "Start with Why"

Simon Sinek's "Start with Why" emphasizes the importance of understanding the core purpose or "why" behind any endeavor. Crafting a compelling "why" statement for your organization involves these key steps:

==== 1. Discover Your Core Beliefs

Start by identifying the fundamental beliefs that drive your organization.
Ask questions like: What principles are non-negotiable? What values define our culture?

==== 2. Define Your Purpose

Clearly articulate the purpose of your organization.
Focus on the impact you want to make beyond products or services.

==== 3. Align with Values

Ensure that your "why" aligns seamlessly with the values of your organization.
This alignment is crucial for authenticity and long-term commitment.

==== 4. Inspire Action

Craft a statement that inspires action and commitment.
Use language that resonates emotionally and motivates people to be part of something meaningful.

==== 5. Be Clear and Concise

Express your "why" in a clear and concise manner.
Avoid complexity; simplicity enhances memorability.

==== 6. Test for Authenticity

Evaluate the authenticity of your "why" statement.
Ensure that it genuinely represents the organization's beliefs and isn't just a marketing tagline.

==== 7. Communicate Consistently

Consistently communicate your "why" across all channels.
Integrate it into your storytelling, branding, and internal communications.

==== 8. Encourage Buy-In

Encourage buy-in from all stakeholders.
Make sure everyone, from employees to customers, understands and embraces the shared purpose.

Be open to evolving your "why" as the organization grows and changes.
A dynamic "why" stays relevant and inspiring.
