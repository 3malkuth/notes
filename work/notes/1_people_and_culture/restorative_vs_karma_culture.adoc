=== Restorative versus Karma Culture

One of the fundamental problems I see in teams or organizations that I work with is an established "karma" culture.
To be honest with you it is a fundamental culture across the globe.
It is a culture that follows this line of thinking...

* Bob breaks the rules
* Because Bob has broken the rules we need to punish him!
** Not just to satisfy our inner need for justice
** But also to set a precedent that for everyone to learn from and to fear lest anyone else breaks the rules

OK you might say to me, this is obvious... this is how our society works,
since most societies are based on a legal system.

OK but what happens when we bring this thinking into a complex bordering on chaotic environment
which many startups and software teams exist in?

People become super afraid of making mistakes as they will be punished and perhaps shamed in front of their colleagues.
