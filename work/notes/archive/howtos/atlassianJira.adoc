=== Screens
You probably want to setup the default fields that are standard for all Issues

* Settings (Cog)
** Issues
*** Screens

You can change the "Default Screen" by configuring it and adding any field you think is useful.

== Story Points
Story Points aren't automatically added to Bugs in Jira.
You need to add them separately.
