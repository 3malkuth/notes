= People Freak Out in Workshop with Others
* Please can you offer an idea of how we can address this problem better?
* Take a Break in the Workshop
** Have a one to one call with that person without everyone there and try to sort it out in the break
* Write the person in a chat and ask them if they want to talk in the Break
