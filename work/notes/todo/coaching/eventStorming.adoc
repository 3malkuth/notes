== Setup
* Create a Modelling Surface
** Brown Paper on Wall
** Or Clingfoil
* Sticky Notes & markers

== First Session
* Decide which value stream to focus on
* Orange Sticky Notes
** Weâ€™re asking you to write the key events in your domain as an orange sticky note, in a verb at past tense, and place them along a timeline from left to right
* Purple Stickies
** Capture Warning Signs - This is where we always have a problem or the process gets stuck...
** Include Blockers
* Since you have everyone you need you can already sort out some low hanging fruit on the fly, but watch the clock...
** YOu can always setup breakout sessions for these issues
