= Product Development, Management, Leadership

== Startup Phase
* Key is to validate the Idea!
* As little code as possible as coding is expensive & takes long
** Cost of being wrong is high
** You don't need to code to validate an idea, there are other ways


== Product Feature, Bugs, Tech Debt&Arch Flow
=== Questions
* How big are your queues?
* What is the cost of these queues?
** How does queue size translate into delay cost?
** We need to know the cost of delay

=== Economic View

==== THE Unit of Measurement
* Life-cycle profit impact
** All other Proxy Variables need to be measured i.t.o this

==== Dangers of Design in Process (DIP)
* Can't see it like typical factory WIP
* DIP is information sitting on storage somewhere

==== Queues are bad!
* Increase variability, risk and cycle time
* Decrease efficiency, quality, motivation

==== Measuring a Subprocess in Economic Terms
* Total cost of sub-process = cost of capacity + delay cost
** WSJF = Cost of Delay / Job Duration (Job Size)

==== Reduce Batch Sizes
* Large batches lead to major delays, variablity etc.
* Link between large batch sizes and transaction costs
