= Strategic Planning

== The Problem
=== Static Approach
* Developed with Management Consultants
* Written in a document
* Filed and never reviewed
* Perhaps used for marketing material

=== Lacking Feedback Mechanisms
* Aren't regularly adjusted based on learnings, new perspectives and changes in the market
* Many miss the opportunity to guide their decision making in the organization


=== Aren't communicated well
** Rarely filter down to the rest of the organization


== Learnings
* Before embarking on a strategic planning journey articulate why a leadership team needs this

== Appendix A: Analogy
* Train
** Why - Fire Cauldron (Power behind the initiative)
** Vision/Mission - Front Point
** Goals / Milestones - Milestones on train track
** Objectives - Wheels
** Values & Principles - Train Track - keep you on track
