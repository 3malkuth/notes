= Bubble Up List
* Instead of using a Kanban Board you can also use a bubble up list

== Bubble-Up Configuration
* Completed TODOs on Top
** Or simply delete them
* Then WIP
* The Prioritised Backlog Underneath

== Lava-Lamp Configuration
* WIP on top
* Prioritised Backlog underneath
* Completed items right at the bottom (strike through line)
** These could theoretically be slightly altered and put back into the backlog again for recurring items
* Flows like a lava lamp
