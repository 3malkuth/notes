=== Mindset

- Curiosity & Openness
-- At the centre of the mutual learning model is genuine
curiosity
-- An effective facilitator approaches group discussions not as a puzzle to be
solved but as a space of exploration
-- They remain open to being influenced, always eager to understand deeper rather than impose a specific direction or conclusion.
- Self-awareness & Reflection
-- The idea of the "self as an instrument" isn't just about skill; it's a mindset.
-- It suggests a deep and ongoing introspection.
-- Facilitators
continuously examine their assumptions, feelings, and behaviours in the context of
the group's process. It's a commitment to personal growth, recognising that their
internal world can influence the group's dynamics.

- Holistic View: Systemic thinking means seeing beyond isolated incidents or
individual behaviours. It's about recognising patterns, connections, and the broader
interplay of group dynamics. This mindset helps the facilitator anticipate issues,
understand underlying causes, and, more importantly, foster a group environment
where members see their collective responsibility.

- Constructive Embrace of Conflict
-- Instead of perceiving conflict as a disruption or a challenge, the facilitator's mindset sees it as a rich source of insight.
-- Conflict, when navigated constructively, can lead to deeper understanding, trust, and stronger group cohesion.

- Commitment to Authenticity
-- Authenticity here isn't just about being genuine; it's a foundational belief in the value of transparency
-- Facilitators believe that for groups to function effectively, they need to navigate the real issues, even if they're uncomfortable
-- This means being open about one's intentions, processes, and even feelings.

- Empowerment & Neutrality
-- Holding the group's agenda above one's own is a
mindset of service.
-- It's the belief that the group has the collective wisdom to arrive
at decisions or insights, and the facilitator's role is to guide and illuminate rather than dictate or decide.
