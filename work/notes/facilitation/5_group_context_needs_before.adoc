=== Understanding Group's Context and Needs

- Purpose and Outcomes
-- Purpose: The foundational reason for holding a session. It answers the 'why' and provides direction, ensuring participants understand the session's importance and remain engaged.
-- Outcomes: These represent the specific goals or results anticipated from the session. Having clear outcomes provides a roadmap, helping keep the session on track and ensuring the intended objectives are achieved.
By establishing a clear purpose and setting defined outcomes, facilitators can effectively
steer discussions and activities, ensuring that meetings are both purposeful and productive.
