=== Establishing Facilitation Presence

==== Techniques to Establish Facilitation Presence

1. Before the Session: Pre-session Engagement: Engage participants before the
session to understand their expectations, clarify doubts, and set the tone.
-- Participant Surveys: Use surveys to gather input on participants' hopes,
concerns, and questions.
--- Scale: 1 - 10. What would need to happen to move this one point ot the right?
--Introductory Email/Message: A warm and informative email can help
participants prepare mentally for the session and connect with you.
-- Agenda Sharing: Share a clear agenda so participants know what to expect.
-- Get the team to do something on the board
--- You need to do it yourself

2. During the Session: Active Listening & Physical Presence
-- Description: Your in-session behaviour significantly impacts how participants
perceive you.
-- Active Listening: Demonstrate that you're genuinely interested in participants' input. Nodding, maintaining eye contact, and paraphrasing can all signal
active listening.
-- Body Language: Stand confidently, use open gestures, and make sure your
facial expressions are attentive and interested.
-- Consistent Engagement: Regularly engage with all participants, especially
the quieter ones, by asking open-ended questions or seeking their opinions.
--- Avoid asking shy peoiple direct questions... "What do you think about this?"
--- Everyone has to put their post-its on the wall and explain them (focus on them). Can destroy the energy.

3. After the Session: Follow-ups & Feedback Collection
-- Description: Presence doesnâ€™t end when the session does. Post-session
activities can leave a lasting impression.
-- Thank You Notes: A simple thank-you note or message for participation can
make participants feel valued.
-- Feedback Collection: Seek feedback on the session and your facilitation
style. This not only shows humility but also commitment to continuous
improvement.
-- Action Points Summary: Send a summarised list of the discussed action
points, ensuring everyone's on the same page.

==== Notes

- If someone is being difficult you could ask them to fill your role in an activity
- If someone is not talkative use tactics such as breaking out into small groups
- There may be occassions for the voice that isn't present
- Have a buddy to practice with
