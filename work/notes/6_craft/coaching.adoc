* *Dysfunctional Teams*
** Start with the 7 categroies and ask the tream where they see the problems in these categories
** Get them to discuss and cluster the topics
** Prioritize the topics
*** Perhaps use impact versus effort??
*** Alternatively, use another appropriate technique
** Once prioritized, get the team to take the first 3 major topics and A3 them!
** or get them to come up with some ideas to address it, measurements for success and an action plan
