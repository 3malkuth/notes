=== Introduction

Many people struggle with the idea of the future.
They are either fearful of it or excited and energized by it.
In my years of working with various organizations and with idividuals (myself included), few are able to plan and in a disciplined and focused manner work their way towards it.

This is a collection of patterns, ideas and approaches I have collected over the years that I have found helpful for people and organizations to start articulating the future and to begin to move towards it.
