=== Mandate

==== Introduction
The idea of a mandate is not something we are used to much in the West these days as our societies are mostly open and are not governed with a tight fist by a monarch. In countries run by monarchs it is not unusual for you to have to receive a mandate from the king or queen to have the right to conduct business.
