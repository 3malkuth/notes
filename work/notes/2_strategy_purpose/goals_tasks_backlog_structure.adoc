=== Goals & Tasks Backlog Structure

==== Introduction
To be honest I wasn't quiter sure what to name this chapter.
Every new project / task framework that comes along tries to come up with a new name for goals and tasks.
Accordingly, I have tried to keep it simple.
I am wanting to provide a simple scaleable option for organizations to systematize their goals setting, tracking and execution in a way that is simple, cleanr ans scaleable.

==== The Structure
With all the teams / organizations I have worked with you shouldn't need more than the following list of itmes

* SMART Goals
* Initiatives / Projects
* Epics / Full Features
* Story, Task, Bug
* Sub-Tasks

==== SMART Goals
Some argue goals don't belong on the backlog of items to be done.
I would agree if you try to frame them as tasks.
Nevertheless, it is helpful to track a list of goals that are in progress and those which are ideas that exist in a backlog.
