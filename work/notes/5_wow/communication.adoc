==== O.R.E.O Formula - Harvard Writing
The *O.R.E.O. formula* is a mnemonic used to organize thoughts and structure persuasive writing. It stands for:

* *Opinion*:
** State your opinion or position on the issue you are writing about.
* *Reasons*:
** Provide reasons or evidence to support your opinion.
* *Explanation*:
** Explain each reason in detail, providing examples or further explanation.
* *Opinion*:
** Restate your opinion, summarizing the main points and reinforcing your position.

The O.R.E.O. formula helps writers present their arguments in a clear and logical manner, making it easier for readers to understand and follow the writer’s perspective.

“O stands for Opinion; tell how you feel about the topic. R stands for Reasons; tell your readers why you feel this way. E stands for Explanations; give your readers examples of why you feel this way. O stands for Opinion; tell readers one more time about your opinion and feelings.” https://www.writingclassroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HowToUseOREOConceptMap.docx.pdf[Ho to use the OREO concept map]

This method is often taught to students as a way to structure persuasive essays and speeches, but it can be applied to various forms of persuasive writing.

Please note that the O.R.E.O. formula is not exclusive to Harvard writing but can be used as a general framework for organizing persuasive arguments.
