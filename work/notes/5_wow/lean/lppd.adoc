=== LPPD
* Lean Product & Process Development
* Don't forget to ask key takeaways each day!
* READ ARTICLE on A3 for LEARNING

==== Introduction

==== Why LPPD?
* Focused on creating new customer value
** Systems optimized to maximize total value
** Drive top Line Growth

* Design the future value streams to deliver the value at the lowest total cost throughout the product's lifecycle
** Product Design can determine 70% of your ongoing costs
** Rather design out waste upfront, than kaizen it out later

==== Focus of lean is FLOW
* Lean focuses on shortening the time betwene the start and completion of a process by eliminating sources of waste
* Shorten time from program approval to production launch be reducing waste

==== Product Development Waste
* 12 Wastes of Product Development
* Transaction Waste - expense reports on travel etc.
* Wishful Thinking - Good intentions, rose coloured glasses
* Sytem Overutilization - Above 80% loading, a process begins to block, jam...
** Psychology, people always want 100% utilization, but leads to jam

==== LPPD Core Principle

===== 1. People First
* All about people
* Keep people in mind in arrow process
* When a surgeon walks into a operating room...
** Oh we forgot the scalpal, can you put in a requisition form... we'll get 3 quotes

===== 2. Understanding before Executing
* Came out of gate slower, but in the long term they were faster

===== 3. Developing Products is a Team Sport
* Product Dev is great in that you have great people from all over the organization
** But they need to be aligned
* *References*

===== 4.Synchronizing Workflows
* Alignment

===== 5. Building in Learning and Knowledge Reuse

===== 6. Designing the Value Stream

==== Study / Concept Phase
* Deeply understand how this product creates unique value
* Ident. & close knowledge gaps - experiment to learn
* Critical attributes... with a plan
* Primary Risks... with a plan
* Align and enroll the team and the organization
* Plan to deliver in the execution phase

==== Product PPT Case Study
* Unit Organizer

==== Deeply Understand what your Product Must Be?
* Go to the Gemba?
* Write down Observations on observation sheet
* (Video: Couples building IKEA together)
** Well
*** Couples see it as a way to connect and have fun
**** they did have fun building it
*** They did make progress
** Not well
*** Instructions not clear
*** Difficult to find parts (visual clarity)
*** Frustration
*** Power dynamics
** General Observations
*** People started without looking at instructions
*** Thought they went the wrong way
**** Not a strong sense of progress
*** created problems not there to begin with
* (IKEA says it takes 5 minutes to build its furniture)
** Well
*** if you follow the instructions you do get to the goal
** Not Well
*** Frustration
*** Quality 
*** Promise of IKEA (5') - totally unrealistic
*** Tooling was not sufficient
** General Observations
*** If you made a wrong turn you could completely break the product

* Outcomes
** Ease of assembly - well formed team or person affay with instructions
*** Well oiled machine
** Quality of the outcome
** Time Cost

* Fun!
* Are you setting up your customers for failure? - Put people first!
* Part labeling & blister packs
* Everyone in the cross-functional team go out together and talk with future customers and dealers

==== Aligning the Organization
* Concept Paper: Aligning the Organization
** What the product must be for the customer / user and business
** Aligned Objectives
* Written by the Chief Engineer
** Often more about the key questions and not providing answers
* "YET" word - better than AND
** Team feels like they are being setup for failure with "AND"
** OR - path of least resistance
* Study Phase is the Kento Phase
* Saying 50% faster etc. means nothing
** Value should rather be in values compared to cmopetiton etc. to make value clear
* Doc Helps guide at the beginning
* As you go through and design the concept you will go into detail
* You may get to the end of the study phase you may decide to pull the plug

* Notes
** Can't move a Chief Engineer into another culture

* *Development through Collaboration*
** Effective cross-functional collaboration
** Home-Room
** Each discipline has a section of the room and maintains its content
** Stand-up meetings are held with the Chief Engineer / Project Manager & Team
*** By walking around the room
** Room evolves as project revolves

* *Collab. in the Study / Concept Phase*
* What the product needs to be
** Customer perspectives
** Business perspectives
*** Sal. & Mark., Manufac., Prod. Eng.
* Make the product visible
** Concept Sketches
** Prototypes

* *Managing the Work: Right Cadence?*
** Depends on the needs / phase of the program
*** Early on less frequent
*** launch Phase - daily
** Also what level obeya

* *Obeya Tips*
** Simple, easy to interpret
** Info
*** What do I need to share with others?
**** You know your work best and what you think others need
*** What do you need from others?
**** Other people don't know what you need
*** Display data to highlight abnormal from normal
** Visualization of the Product (Mock-Ups, Renderings, Drawings, CAD etc.)
** Leading Metrics
** Glide-Paths for Product Metrics
** Andon in place to flag issues and ask for help
*** helpful help dpoesn't create new work for the person to address the issue
** Adjust info and visuals to fit everyone's needs as the program evolves

* *Obeya Room Layout*
** Provide an example here...
** You may have several programs in one room if the programs overlap
** Connect programs / projects where their is overlap / dependencies
** We want to organize the functions in such a way that the people feel resp. for solving their probelms and not waiting for a manager
** Not a war room as war rooms are for escalation
*** We want the soldiers and officers to sort out their own problems

* *Create Flow & Eliminate Waste for Speed to Market*
1. Understand the Work - Make it visual
2. Plan the Work - Create Flow & Eliminate Waste
3. Manage the Work - See abnormal from normal and respond

* *Understanding the Work: Project Flow & Decisions*
** During the project
*** Tasks
*** Deliverables
*** Decisions
** tasks and deliverables need to occur, but it is the decisions that ultimately drive the flow of a project
** Knowing what decisons need to make show us what we need ot learn
*** ...

* *Design Decision Flow*
** Why?
** Understand together the decisions that need to be made across the org. on a given project
** Identify what we need to learn to make the right decision at the right time
** Understand together the interdependencies of decisions...
** ...

* Design Dec. 2
** understand decisions and cadence needed to enable a continuous flow through early phases of the development cycle
** Streamline...

* *Design Decision Flow - Part 3*
** How?
1. Define
2. Hierarchy
3. Cadence
4. Control

* *Design Decision Flow - Part 4*
** Swimlanes
** Around functional areas (PM, Sales, Ind. Eng., Product Eng...)
** Or around modules
** Sequence decisions in the approx. order in which they need to be made

* *Design Decision Flow - Part 5*
** Place decisions on timeline in swimlanes

* *Design Decision Flow - Part 6*
** Team reviews to analyze decisions in swimlanes

* *Tasks, Decisions*
** focus on decisions

* *Draw a Design Decision Flow Map*
** Brainstorm all key product, process and project decisions
** Sequence the Decisions in the order in which the team beleives the shoudl be made
*** Diamonds represent decisions

* *Program Manager*
** How many parts will be in the final packaged kit

* *Sales & Marketing*
** Arows represent interdependencies

* Every 2 weeks do a retro on the obeya to improve it
** Kaizen!
*** Small experiments within larger experiements

* *Obtaining the Knowledge to Mkae Decisions*
** Eliminate the biggest risk - inadequate knowledge!
** More knowledge to be discovered than time and resources available
*** Choose wisely: prioritization, newness, difficulty
** Shifting from "doing" to "learning" - Use PDCA
** Rapid learning cycles are synchronized sets of experiments to remove uncertainty, manage risk and build knowledge before key decisions need to be made during a product development project.
** Either you make xperiement snow or the clock will force you to make a big jump

* *Rapid Learning*
** identify & prio. what you need to learn to close knowledge gaps to make decisions
** Create a plan to learn what you need to as fast...
** ...

* *Key Events in a Rapid Learning Cycle*
** Image

* *Enablers to Rapid Learning*
** Parkinson's law we will fill time available
** More time? Effort? Cost? Learning?
** What is the granularity of learning we need?
*** MVP - only as much detail as needed

* *Models for RLC Execution*
** Can't just let people loose, they need a sctructure (PDCA)
*** good old scientific method...
** Decision diamonds linked to rapid learning cycles
* Now you can add the tasks linked to decisions

* An asteroid is going to hit the earth tomorrow, how are you going to get the answer


==== Session 4: Execution Phase
* *Detailed Execution Phase*
** Aligned on vision and plan - now time to deliver
** Execution Matters
** Speed with Precision (No trade-off!)
** Transparency and collaboration across the enterprise

* *Create Flow & Elim. Waste for speed & improv. exec.*
1. Understand the Work - Make it visual
2. Plan the Work - Create flow and eliminate waste
3. Manage the Work - See abnormal from normal and respond

* *Traditional Prod. & Process Development*
** Waterfall!
*** Rework and churn is increased if we don't regularly deliver
** Continuous and Concurrent Flow
*** Get rid of danger if we collaborate and fast feedback
** Lots of collaboration (think vertical slices)
** Fast Feedback

* *??*

* *Visual Schedule*
** Understand, plan, manage the work together
** Purpose: Simple standards where everyone can see the work and understand the current situation of the project timing and risks
** Beige - Task / Deliverable
** Blue Diamond - Milestones
** Pink - Risks & Concerns

* *??*

* *Leading Indicators*
** Determine if a project is on-track to meeting its goals (ahead or behind?)
** Visual - quickly see normal vs abnormal
** Provide enough time to proactively adjust - new countermeasures ("helpful" help...)

* *Leading Indicators: Operational Readiness Levels*
** See if Prod / VS Dev activities ar eon track

* *Example: Manufacturing Readiness Levels (MRL)*
** R&D - Proj. team - Commercialization

* synchronized versus unsynchronized concurrent work

==== Session 5: People First, Case Studies & Next Steps

* *Agenda*

* *Execution Phase Summary*
* Aligned Vision
* Execute with speed and precision
** 
* Transparency & Collaboration
** Importance of structured problem solving and not firefighting
* Concurrently designing the product and value stream
** DONE DONE

* *Key Takeaways*

* *Respect people, who are central to everything in LPPD*
** Putting people first
** Is the way we are using this process empowering and enabling people or hindering?
*** Structure things in a way that people spend on gaining new knowledge and not on knowledge already gained
*** Think through the principles like this accordingly

* *Business Results - 1*

* *Business Results - 2*

* *Lean as a socio-technical system - 1*
** MS = LB x OS (from "Designing the Future")
** Effectiveness of MS = Leadership Behaviors x Operating System

* *Lean as a socio-technical system -2*
** Organic
** Enabling Bureaucracy
*** What we try to achieve with lean
** Coercive Bureaucracy
* Autocratic

* *Lean as a socio-technical system -3*
** Systems, Processes, Tools -> Business Results
** Use Obeya as a tool to help people to better understand eahc others work etc.
** Need to communciate!

* *Lean as a socio-technical system -4*
** Leadership, Indiv. Behav. and Systems... Biz results drawing

* *Putting People First into Practice*
** Psychology
** Maslow's Hierarch of Needs - Safety here is also psychological safety
*** You need to meet the need at the bottom before you can move onto the next one
** The Fearless Organization - Psych. Safety Book
** Lean Tools will not work if there is no psychological safety!!
*** They won't voice and identify problems

* *Consider a Basic Management System*
** Andon - signal cord - TL needs to respond with helpful help
*** If getting yelled at instead of getting help will affect people's needs
*** Not what you do, but how people feel about what you are doing as a leader
*** Don't ignore people
** TL shows up and doesn't know what to do?
*** Can be helpful, but some people see this as the end of the business
** I'm not getting blamed for shutting down the line!
** What we want is worker gets immediate help with helpful help

* *Better Performance through Putting People First*
** Maslow's top part - self actualization
** Pink built on the top part of Maslow with "Drive"
*** Motivation - Purpose, Autonomy, Mastery
*** Intrinsic Motivation is what you need for creativity, not necessarily other tasks
** We need efficiencies thats why we are building a bureaucracy, but they need place for their autonomy
** This is why in Obeya you need to give people a section they own

* *Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose in Practice*
** appell.org - full potential in practice
** https://www.appell.org/2020/09/30/full-potential-in-practice/
** At some point you max out potetnial for mastery in an area or activity

* *Deliberately Creating the Conditions for Better Performance*
** Create conditions for people to discuss and fulfill their needs
*** Psych. Safety
** Be explicit on how practices enable people to fulfill their needs
*** PDCA

* *Be explicit and Transparent about Expectations*
** using obeya
*** Aut
*** Mast
*** Purp
** What actually happens?
** How dowe adjust...?


* *Be explicit and Transparent about Expectations Andon system expectations*
** OS
** Tech Syst

* *People Issues Discussions*
** Autonomy - Delegation Poker (Management 3.0)
** Mastery - Obeya helps you to find and give resp. to solve it (A3)
** Purpose - Concept Doc and visualisation of goals
** Job Demand (Purpose), Control (Autonomy), Support (Mastery - Skills) Model is similar
** J example of workers improving change over time on machine to 10'
** Challenge of chaotic company that says they don't have time or don't see point of putting in structures
** Read Book with P-51
** Obeya is not working! Yesit is its hsowing they are not committed and need help
*** Often people don't realize the impact of their behaviour
** Obeya gets rid of these monthly death by powerpoint
** Upper levels want to be engaged but don't know how to be engaged

* *LPPD Approach: Experiments & Learning*
** Leadership PDCA
** Pilot, run an experiment
** A few experiements going on where they can learn from each other
** Gives you a chance to rion the supportive mech. needed
** Gives leadership chance to understand their bandwidht for change

* *Examples: Steps for the Pilot Project*
** A sponsor ro two to get this off the ground
