= A3 Foundations

== Why A3?
I have always wanted to find a structured approach to problem solving using the PDCA cycle (Plan-Do-Check-Act). When I came across the A3 process I had found the right tool for the job.At the time I didn't realize that I had stumbled across a tool that I could use for so many different situations e.g. mentoring, project management, strategic planning... the list goes on.

In this article I want to introduce the tool, process and thinking behind A3. In later articles I will go a little deeper into each section.

== What is the A3 Tool?
The tool typically uses a single sheet of ISO A3-size paper, which is the source of its name; however, you can use software to replace the paper e.g. spreadsheets.

A typical A3 includes the following sections on the sheet of paper

|===
.3+| Title:| Owner:
| Signature:
| Version:


| Background: | Countermeasures:
| Current State: | Plan:
| Goals / Objectives:
.2+| Feedback & Learnings:
| Analysis:
|===

The format helps with the following:
* Clearly communicating the problem, goals, issues, countermeasures etc.
* Root cause analysis
* Planning
* Reporting
* Discussing
* General state of the problem

With A3 thinking we have an iterative structure for working toward our goals.
The A3 process answers these questions:

* what's the real problem? Why does it need to be addressed now?
* Owner of the Problem?
* Root causes of this issue
* Possible options
* How can we prioritize the countermeasures?
* How do we get agreement with the stakeholders
* What's the plan and rough timetable?
* How will we measure effectiveness of the countermeasures?
* What implementation plan can we anticipate?
How do we ensure follow up and continuous improvement

== What is the A3 Process?
The process in the A3 form was pioneered at Toyota before being spread through the "lean" movement.
The A3 process helps you to use PDCA thinking in your approach to problem solving.
It also challenges you to live continuous imporvement (Kaizen).
A3 provides a simple and structured procedure for guding people through their problem solving process.

The process also helps people learn their way forward. When implemented correctly it should lead to effective countermeasures based on real facts and associated data.

== Leadership Development
One of the biggest challenges a leader faces is that they need to get work done and develop people at the same time.
The A3 process assists leaders in solving this problem.

== Steps behind A3 Thinking
* Title - Whats the challenge?
** Prioritization - Why do we need to deal with this now?
* Owner - Who is taking ownership for this challenge?
* Version - Is this the first time we have addressed this issue?
* Current State - Where do we stand right now?
* Goals / Objectives - Where do we want to be?
* Analysis - What are the real root causes of the challenge we are facing?
* Countermeasures - What can we do about it?
** How will you decide which countermeasures to implement first?
** How do we get everyone on board?
* Plan - How are we going to roll out the countermeasures?
** Who, What, Where, When, Howâ€¦
* How will we measure the success or failure of the countermeasures?
* What could block us as we roll out the plan?
** What could go wrong?
* How will you capture and share the learning?
* How will you make sure actions are reviewed?
* What will you do to ensure continuous improvement in the future?

== Structured Storytelling
A3 thinking can also be thought of as structured storytelling. The "story" begins at the top right and moves through to the bottom right.
