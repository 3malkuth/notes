=== Building your Inner Circle


* *Inner Circle*
* Close people who interact with you
* Why people are over coaching as its too expensive
* Why you should merge your platform community to your inner circle
* Annuity revenue
* How they can benefit
* How to build an asset

* *Howto*
** Advertising / Platforms are too much info overload
** You have to bring your goal group to a central place that you control
*** No social media etc.
** Your network is your "net worth"
*** As soon as you build a network you begin to draw others to you as they see the value of the people in your network
*** Partnerships etc. come together etc.
*** More transformational than high price coaching for 1-2 months
** Your community becomes transformative if you just create the right network
** We get paid as coaches to bring your coaches from A to B
** Self Employed - How can I? Entrepreneur - Who can do this?

** *New way of doing Business*
** Turn your passion into a community and make money
** Why would people pay for something they can get for free in a free community?
** Wrong question!
** How much longer are people prepared to pay for something very expensive that they don't understand
** Das Abo-Zeitalter Buch
*** This is the new way of making money
*** People don't want to own something, but use something
*** Everything is going in the direction of Abo's
*** Gives them the chance to get to know you first
*** They don't want stuff for free as they know then they are the product then (their data etc.)
** Choose the right topic

** *OK, how?*
*** How can I build my own community, how much does it cost etc.
*** I want an asset (don't want to start from scratch each month)
*** That it works for time etc. that I am not doing overtime etc.
*** I want to have fun!
*** It must have an impact

* *Solution*
** Exclusive VIP spaces
** 1. Austausch (Community can talk with each other - give them bonuses for that)
** 2. eLearning (You need to be an expert in your area) - People can consume in their time
** 3. Live Events - Regular Q&A's - just use Zoom etc. at the start

* *Fazit*
** People are prepared to pay monthly for inner circle communities
*** The market is not keen any longer to pay for expensive coachings up front
** Sie tun es auch bei dir
*** Just need the right topic where you are the expert
** You just need to creat the right space for them to connect
