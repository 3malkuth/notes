== Leading Women at Work

=== Introduction
Over the last few decades their has been a lot of emphasis placed on ensuring women are treated justly and fairly in the workplace.
Much focus has been placed on structures to ensure equity and much has been written on leadership from a women's perspective, but not many people have addressed the challenge many men face who are in a position of leadership and need to lead women well in this new work context.

I thought it might be helpful for men to have a helpful guide to help them as they navigate this territory.

=== Typical challenges women face in the workplace
* Pregnancy discrimination
** Many working women face challenges when starting a family. Pregnancy discrimination involves unfair treatment, bias, and lack of accommodations for pregnant employees1.
* Sexual harassment
** Workplace sexism and harassment are prevalent issues that can create a hostile environment for women1.
Gender pay gap: Women often face disparities in pay compared to their male counterparts1.
* Lack of work-life balance
** Balancing work and personal life can be challenging for women2.
* Insufficient childcare support
** The lack of accessible and affordable childcare options can hinder women’s career advancement3.
* Underrepresentation in leadership roles
** Women are often underrepresented in executive positions1.
* Unconscious bias
** Stereotypes and biases can affect women’s opportunities for growth and advancement1.
* Limited access to flexible work arrangements
** Flexible work options can benefit women, but they may not always be available or supported by employers3.
* Career advancement opportunities
** Women may face barriers when it comes to career progression and accessing leadership roles4.
* Workplace culture and norms
** Organizational cultures that perpetuate gender stereotypes or lack inclusivity can create challenges for women1.

=== Giving Feedback
* Create a Safe and Open Environment
* I really recommend the feedback wrap as a structure for giving feedback
** You don't have to always set the context, esp. if you are meeting face to face

=== Mentoring
