== TODO------------------------

== Scaling Teams

== Team Process


== Scrum of Scrums (SoS)
* Operates like Scrum Team - Team of Teams
* Has single PO & SM, but includes 4 - 5 teams (Harvard Research 4.6)

* Not a meeting
* 

== Product Owner
* Team should only see one Product Owner defining their priorities
* PO is not a project manager


== Scaled Meetings
* Try and keep all sclaed meetings in the time framof the sprint they address

=== Scaled Sprint Planning
* Try and do this on the same day as the planning meetings for the scrum teams

=== Scaled Sprint Review
* If possible get the team to show their work in all reviews
** More pride and ownership
** Helps to develop people who need to demo to executives
* You should still have a team review!
* Marketplace Option
** Teams setup booths showcasing what they have done
** About 2 Hours
** Stakeholders can choose where they want to go
** Open Space - law of 2 feet

=== Scaled Sprint Retro

=== Scaled Quarter Review??, Retro, Planning
* Take 1 - 3 days to:
** Do a review of the Quarters OKRs (1/2 Day)
** Do a retro of the entire quarters results (1/2 Day)
** Plan the next Quarters OKRs (1 - 2 Days)

== EAT

* EAT delegate Coaching competency to the Agile Practice (internal coaching community, community of practice) or Agile Practice sits in the EAT
** The goal of external coaches should be to train the internal coaches
* Agile Practice can also be broken up into cross-.functional teams

== Questions
* How should teams scale interdependence?
* How to handle architecture & quality at scale
** Community of Practice
** Chapter - where u need alignment in teams, have reps form teams
** Guilds - everyone from the entire org who is a java prog as example gather to shre best practices

== Notes
* Main aim of metrics and transparency are to help us stop burning out people and help teams to sustainably produce software at a constant pace
* Don't do feature branching - pick and mix!!!
** Integration frought with problems
** Rather use feature flags / feature toggles

* Traditional Project Management
** Scope, Cost, Time, Quality
** Often quality is always sacrificed
** In Agile we remove quality as a control variable
* Use buyer-feature game to get executives to focus on what they can actually invest in - monopoly money to buy initiatives - then they collaborate. I will help you with your initiative if you help me with mine
* Create a kanban on the level of the group
** e.g. an initiative kanban board
