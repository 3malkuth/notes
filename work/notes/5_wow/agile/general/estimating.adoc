= Estimating

* But I thought we don't estimate in agile...
** We do
** However, we don't fix the scope of our estimates
** Time, Cost, Quality (Definition of Done) are fixed in Scrum
** Only scope is not
** However through our velocity and as we improve our estimating, our estimates get better and better over time empirically

== Problems when we don't estimate
* Often teams tend to over-commit when they have no data to track their capaciyt as a team

== Anti-patterns
* Do not create several estimating units e.g. User Story Points, Feature Story Points, Initiative Story Points...

== Estimating at Scale

=== Baseline Value of Story Points?
* Find a clever approach to baselining that isn't direct...
** Have a standard estimate system - same pictures for a 1,2,3...
** You can have the same baseline stories for all teams
* You could also get all teams to estimate together

== Sizes
* Tasks should not be estimated in time
** Tasks defined should be between half day and one day in size - no need to make a time estimate
* Stories should be split smaller as they bubble up the backlog priority
* Typical team of 5 developers should get about 15 Stories done per sprint.
** Thus Stories should be about 1 - 3 SP's

== Bucket Estimation
* Setup a Visual Fibonacci Scale (1,2,3,5,8,13)
* First everyone QUIETLY
