= Roles in Agile

== People Manager / Reporting Team Leader
* Body of knowledge - Beyond Budgeting
* Scrum Erfolgsfaktor personelle management
* SM & PO not line managers
* No targets, but rate improvements
* Line Manager - career path development
* Bosch - originally team leads with disc. auth.
* How to decide if people get a raise
* Don't touch the pay grade
* Read "Maverick" - different ways of structuring
* 360° appraisals
* Management 3.0
** Nice game to figure out who should get a raise

== UX
* UX should probably be done by the PO
* One could have an outsourced partner that assist the PO?
* I wouldn't necessarily pay someone to do this full time as an internal role
