= Preparing PBIs With ATDD & 3 Amigos

== Howto

=== Start
* PO captures the use case in a PBI

=== Standup 1
* PO informs the team in the next Standup that he has a new PBI to refine with the Team
** Alternative is that when the PBI is moved into the "Refine" column it is a signal that it needs to be refined, when team is ready to pull they setup a short meeting - Pull concept
* PO asks for a “3 Amigo’s” session after the Standup
* The Team decides who of the Testers & Dev’s will be in 3-Amigo’s Session
** Can also make it 4-Amigo's and include UX / Design?

=== 3 Amigo’s Refinement
* In the 3-Amigo’s Session the following happens:
* PO discusses the use case
* The group discussion
** Discussion should be focused on drawing out the acceptance criteria
* Once the stakeholder expectations are understood, begin to formalize the acceptance tests (natural language)
* Distill Tests in a Framework-Friendly Format
* Add extra test for technical debt where we can make add good refactorings

=== Standup 2
* PO informs team of the PBI refinement and asks for feedback
* Encourages the team to check PBI during the day and provide feedback

=== Team Refinement
* Everyone familiar with PBI so they do a final sanity check and add estimates where necessary for the PBI
* Can discuss a PBI within 3’ - 5’

== Benefits
* Smaller steps and regular refinement
* Testers can pair on the test they helped to define (timeboxed)
* Less ping-pong with QA
