Elon Musk is reported to have said that, https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnbbrandon/2021/02/03/elon-musk-made-one-very-profound-statement-during-his-infamous-clubhouse-chat/[“Fear is not the mind-killer, context switching is the mind-killer...”]

Context switching is something we all do, all the time these days as we jump from one app to the next checking messages, replying, creating and reading content.

However some say that this actually isn't so bad.

What are the issues, who is right? These are some things I want to explore in this article.
