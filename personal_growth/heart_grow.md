## Growing your Heart

If your heart is not just emotions and entails a large
part of your inner being, then growing your heart would entail
growing in love and character, faith and hope.

## Character

```
Not only this, but we also rejoice in sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance, character, and character, hope. And hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.
Romans 5:3-5
