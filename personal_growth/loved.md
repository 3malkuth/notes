## Identity

Before we try to get people to change we need them to first understand that they:
* Belong
* Unique
* Have purpose - the exist for a reason
* They are loved

### Unique
In Genesis 1, we understand that mankind was a special creation of YHWH,
created in "our" image: reflecting and representing YHWH to His creation.

### Belonged
YHWH placed mankind in a garden where they belonged: the place of intimate realtionship
and also a place where they could grow to maturity and have the opportunity to develop
their skills etc.

### Purpose
YHWH gave mankind the mandate off governing and subduing the planet... in essence to align it
with heaven.

### Loved
What an intimate relationship we see where YHWH breathes life into Adam like a kiss.
YHWH loved His creation.
