## The heart
A biblical understanding of the heart seems to refer to the inner part of your being (that part is not physical).

### The heart includes...

#### Mind / Place of thought
* Matthew 9:4 - Jesus asks the scribes why they are thinking evil in their hearts?

#### Will / Decision making
* Acts 11:23 - Encourage people to be purposeful in staying with the Lord with their hearts
* Being purposeful pertains to decision - an act of the will

#### Emotions
* John 16:22 - I will see you again and your heart will rejoice
* Rejoicing pertains to emotion

#### Conscience
* Hebrews 10:22 - Have your heart sprinkled from an evil conscience
* 1 John 3:20 - If your heart blames us...
* Perceiving right from wrong

### The purpose of the heart is...

#### To love
* The heart is at the center of our relationship with YHWH
  * We sense His love and respond with love from our hearts
* Mark 12:30 - You shall love the Lord with your whole heart

#### To be a gateway to our entire inner being

#### Our heart and YHWH
* Our relationship with YHWH is not just started in the heart, but also maintained here
* If there is something in your heart that displeases or blocks the Lord it affects your relationship with Him like it would any other person with whom you have a relationship.

### Problems
* Mark 12:29-30 - Jesus calls us to love YHWH with all your heart, soul, mind and strength
  * Why is mind and soul seperated from heart?

### Cultivating a healthy heart
* If there is a problem... it is on your side!
  * YHWH did everything necessary to ensure we would never have a closed door to Him.
  * If we are feeling disconnected, rejected, alone etc. the problem is on our side.
  * We are the one's who have closed the door through our actions!
* Create in me a pure heart...
* Colossians 3:16 - Dwell on the Word
